    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Lord, give me chastity and continence, but not yet!</p><p><strong>St. Augustine</strong></p></div></blockquote><p>In 1863, William Lang ran a mile in 4 minutes and 2 seconds, a record that would endure for 80 years. Standing undefeated across the decades, across two world wars, from horse and cart to television and airplanes, the record attained a mythical status. After innumerable failed attempts at breaking it, the 4 minute mile was considered impossible. Experts claimed the human heart would explode from the strain.</p><p>In 1954, Roger Bannister did what doctors had declared <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/7404?seq=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">physically impossible</a>: he ran a mile in under 4 minutes. A few weeks later the record was crushed again, and then another 46 times within just three years.</p><p>The essay you are reading right now is the four minute mile of Fucking.</p><h3 id="Monk-Life"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/02/25/the-harem-of-an-autist/#Monk-Life" class="headerlink" title="Monk Life"></a>Monk Life</h3><p>Starting in my 20s, I spent about 15 years being celibate. Not because I couldn&#39;t get laid, I just chose not to. I was more interested in reading books than chasing women. A mediocre relationship as a teenager, feeling like I had to change who I was in order to get women (and turn into something I didn&#39;t like), feeling like I was undesirable, and generally just being more interested in learning at this time led me down that path. Then one day, at 34, I got bored and suddenly decided to make Fucking my autistic special interest. Soon, I was juggling relationships with multiple women and turning down eager propositions because I had better things to do.</p><p>Of course, I had to leave some things behind. I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TelElTAONQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">betrayed the philosophical life</a>. Didn&#39;t read very much, and certainly didn&#39;t write anything. The mind atrophies as more and more blood is dedicated to engorging the penis, starving the brain of its essential nutrients and withering away its noumenal capacities.</p><p>This isn&#39;t a pickup guide. It&#39;s the story of a self-experiment. It&#39;s a case study in arbitrary limitations and choosing one&#39;s character. It&#39;s about social scripts. And it&#39;s about the discovery that what many consider to be rare and precious is actually abundant and easily accessible, if only you choose to pursue it.</p><p>People convince themselves of the absurd nonsense like &quot;I&#39;m just not good with women&quot;, &quot;I&#39;m too old to start dating seriously&quot;, &quot;I&#39;m not attractive enough for casual sex&quot;. These are nothing more than meaningless fixed ideas, and you can just wake up one day and decide to follow a different one.</p><p>Before we go further, let&#39;s establish that I&#39;m not some gigachad by nature. I&#39;m in my late 30s, tall and lean, not particularly handsome, and with the kind of light balding that says &quot;I read too much philosophy&quot;. I&#39;m a pretty good baker, I have a decent job that nobody is impressed by or interested in, and in the end I&#39;m fundamentally a weird nerd writing esoteric blog posts on the internet.</p><h3 id="What-39-s-a-Vagina"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/02/25/the-harem-of-an-autist/#What-39-s-a-Vagina" class="headerlink" title="What&#39;s a Vagina?"></a>What&#39;s a Vagina?</h3><p>So what is it like to be a manwhore? Pretty sweet, actually. (If you were wondering why I haven&#39;t written a real essay in 2 years, now you know.) But it didn&#39;t start out that way...</p><p>My approach to trying new things is to dive into the deep end of the pool and figure out if I can swim. So, naturally, the first thing I did was to buy some leather handcuffs and a wand vibrator. I took a few decent pics, created a tinder profile, and started swiping.</p><p>My first date a few days later was a cute 21 year-old Ukrainian girl. We had a quick chat on the app and I invited her out for a drink. We met up outside the metro, walked to a bar and had a pleasantly anodyne chat for about an hour or so. I did not touch her beyond an initial hug. At that point I asked her if she wanted to come back to my place; she was up to it, and we headed off. On the walk back I thought to myself: &quot;what the hell are all those people on the internet talking about? Dating is the easiest thing in the world&quot;.</p><p>She asked me about my sexual experience, especially with BDSM, but I was too insecure to tell her the truth, so I bullshitted about how some ex introduced me to the idea a couple of years ago.</p><p>We got back to my place and started making out on the couch a bit. It was at this point that ambition and reality came crashing into each other. I suddenly realized that I did not remember how any of this worked. I was basically a virgin all over again. I took her into the bedroom, but everything was <em>off</em>. I was too nervous, too eager, moving too fast. Neither of us was comfortable. I could barely get hard. Neither of us came. A disaster on every level.</p><p>I walked her down to the tram stop and never contacted her again. The embarrassment was just too bad.</p><p>The second time around was...not much better. And the third one too. Let me quote some of my dating notes from this time:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>It is probably too early to judge after 4 dating partners, but thus far the apps have brought me nothing but disappointment, pain, and anxiety. I can&#39;t even get hard for the women I sleep with. I sincerely hope there is something better down the line because otherwise I am so fucked.</p></div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Initially thought I&#39;d just fuck around, but very quickly discovered I was not built for casual sex. Don&#39;t enjoy sex all that much to begin with tbh. Can barely cum from it, when I manage to get hard! (Later note: maybe this was a bit misguided? (Later later note: it was misguided.)) [note from significantly later: casual sex is good actually]</p></div></blockquote><p>But I kept trying, figuring out what to do and what not to do, getting feedback from my partners, experimenting with all sorts of new things, and just generally getting the hang of it. About a month after starting, I met someone I became madly infatuated with, fumbled it hard, and it was all over after just 4 dates. My notes are amusing in retrospect, so earnest:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Intrusive thoughts all the time, even when I&#39;m spending intimate time with other women [...] I&#39;m terrified of doing the wrong things, being too honest or not honest enough, coming on too strong or not strong enough. I&#39;m scared that by liking you too much I&#39;m going to start repulsing you: afraid of challenging you, acting like a doormat. Nobody wants a doormat.</p></div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Went from fucking being happy all on my own to the utter bullshit of limerence, loneliness, neediness...this shit better be worth it in the long run, man.</p></div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>What if in the end our relations are the only thing that really matters, and it&#39;s too late for me? What if I&#39;m totally fucked?</p></div></blockquote><p>That was my first inkling that I really wanted something more than just casual sex, but I also felt the need to explore more before trying to settle down.</p><p>I had grown up on a steady diet of third-hand dating wisdom: I needed to act like a douche, develop &quot;game,&quot; become some sort of Alpha Chad. Early on, dating felt like a rollercoaster partly because I was not really secure in myself. A week without any matches would feel depressing, a week with multiple dates would make me feel like I was on top of the world. Fundamentally the issue was that I was looking for external validation and trying to protect or build up a fragile ego. [not sure if this fits here]</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>So easy to get discouraged, even when things are going relatively well, I&#39;m banging multiple women, etc. One failure and I&#39;m feeling bad ffs.</p></div></blockquote><p>What took a while to figure out was that being a weirdo worked just fine. More than &quot;just fine&quot;, it was the right thing to do, because that&#39;s the only way you can attract people who are really into <em>you</em>. Breaking through the initial pain and anxiety was crucial though, I think it&#39;s easy to get caught in a cycle of low self-esteem, failing to improve, and self-sabotaging, which just causes more low self-esteem. But I just picked up the pieces, kept learning, and kept going. I tried to embrace rejection: fear of rejection is paralyzing, yet actual rejection gives clarity, courage, and finality. The absurd thing is that even after dozens of rejections, the fear never gets easier. The lesson seems impossible to internalize—maybe I needed more repetitions? Should&#39;ve done 5x5 rejections twice a week like some kind of twisted gym routine?</p><h3 id="The-Harem-of-an-Autist"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/02/25/the-harem-of-an-autist/#The-Harem-of-an-Autist" class="headerlink" title="The Harem of an Autist"></a>The Harem of an Autist</h3><p>Between August 2022 and June 2024 I went on 36 first dates with women of 26 different ethnicities. I slept with 17 of them, and had steady relationships with 7. From portfolio managers to women with shaved heads and dagger tattoos on their chest, I was mostly drawn to the &quot;art hoes&quot;.</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/arthoe.png" title="art hoe definition." alt="I don&apos;t play guitar or skate."><span class="image-caption">I don&apos;t play guitar or skate.</span><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It didn&#39;t take long for me to figure out what to do in bed. Six months after my first date, one of my friends with benefits used the words &quot;transcendent&quot; and &quot;I felt something die in me&quot; to describe our night together. But my brain was busy cataloguing her self-absorption and being bored.</p><p>A curious thing I noticed was that many of the women I dated weren&#39;t actually seeing other guys on the side. Some were uninterested, unwilling to put in the effort, while some (even really cute girls) seemed to have trouble finding even someone willing to bang them. So I found myself in a weird harem situation, dating 3-4 women at a time, having threesomes and generally living a life of debauchery. My calendar looked like a messy game of Tetris.</p><p>This is the timeline of all my dates/relationships (blue: had sex; red: no sex):</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/dating_gantt.jpg" title="gantt chart" alt="Nothing says &apos;catch&apos; like a man who Gantt-charts his dating history."><span class="image-caption">Nothing says &apos;catch&apos; like a man who Gantt-charts his dating history.</span><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The reality of being a &quot;player&quot; was not always what I had imagined it to be though. Take Alice, for example: she was kind of a hopeless romantic who had spent a decade pining over her ex. Three dates in, she was clearly falling for me harder than I was for her. She was lovely: beautiful, intelligent, great in bed, had her shit together. She wrote me poems. We even lived together for a couple of months. And yet for some reason beyond my understanding, I felt an emotional distance that could not be overcome. I think on some subconscious level I was getting off on making her fall for me even more, but the screwed up power dynamic just gave me a hollow feeling. I almost stopped reading during my relationship with her, and my creativity died completelyal. I realized that I needed something different out of my partner, something with more intensity, even if it means having to go through more turbulence. Alice thought we&#39;d date for a year and amicably go our separate ways, and that&#39;s what happened in the end.</p><p>Having women compete for your attention, maintaining multiple relationships, the power to say &quot;no&quot;—it pumps up your ego in a way that feels amazing at first but eventually reveals itself to be a bit empty. You end up creating these parallel lives, each relationship its own little universe that never quite achieves escape velocity. Sometimes that&#39;s exactly what you want. But it gets old.</p><p>In the midst of all this, I met some truly remarkable people. Despite things not working out romantically in the long run, I&#39;m genuinely grateful for their presence in my life. I don&#39;t think failed relationships are a waste of time, not every connection needs to last forever to be meaningful. Some people are just passing through your life, leaving it better than they found it. And hopefully you leave them better than you found them. I also fucked up, more than once. I hurt people who didn&#39;t deserve it—made promises I didn&#39;t keep, acted in ways that I&#39;m not proud of. Sometimes other people had to pay the price of my learning curve.</p><p>The one thing I was consistent about was being radically open and honest about everything, including seeing other people. Every time I tried to be &quot;strategic&quot; it backfired spectacularly. The whole pickup artist mythology about being a manipulative seductor is complete bullshit.</p><p><strong>The Dating</strong></p><p>Sex is easy to get in enormous quantities; finding someone you actually <em>like</em> is basically impossible. In the end, the game is probabilistic—you have to keep trying, keep meeting people, keep rolling the dice until you find something real. The scariest thing is that compatibility is mostly ineffable. The evidence collected <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6yiayg5QWtWme4JN8/anatomy-of-a-dating-document?commentId=ctD7rHdPpwdSW8jMt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by gwern</a> is extremely interesting, and basically boils down to this: it&#39;s impossible to predict a couple&#39;s romantic success based on their explicit characteristics. Understanding this also helped me understand why the relationship with Alice didn&#39;t work out. The best you can do is try to minimize false negatives by letting go of your preconceptions and dating broadly.</p><p>That said, I found myself drawn to women who were independent, challenging, intelligent, creative, and unapologetically weird, the ones who weren&#39;t entirely sane but were intensely curious about the world. Other than lack of physical attraction, the most typical reason I would reject someone was &quot;they&#39;re boring&quot;—after spending years hanging out with 155 IQ schizophrenic metapolitical anarchomonarchists on the internet, conversation with normal people can start to feel a bit plain.</p><p>More on this in a future essay.</p><h4 id="The-Sex"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/02/25/the-harem-of-an-autist/#The-Sex" class="headerlink" title="The Sex"></a>The Sex</h4><p>Great sex comes from the same place as great relationships: openness, honesty, and genuine confidence. When you&#39;re comfortable with yourself and actually give a fuck about your partner&#39;s pleasure, spectacular things can happen. Sometimes your partners will orgasm so hard they start crying, and that&#39;s a good thing.</p><p>Just as runners for decades believed breaking that barrier was physically impossible, most people have convinced themselves that transcendent sex is out of reach, that &quot;good enough&quot; is the best they can hope for. They&#39;ve internalized stories about how men are just naturally bad at sex, how women are difficult to please, how great sexual chemistry is rare and magical rather than just a learnable skill. But mastering this skill means leaving your ego at the door.</p><p>The truth is this: the bar for men is on the fucking floor. The vast majority of guys are absolutely terrible at sex, to a degree that is almost unbelievable. I met multiple beautiful women with bodycounts in the dozens who had essentially never had good sex in their lives before meeting me. Not because I&#39;m some magical sex god, but simply because I gave a damn and put some passion into it.</p><p>A strange realization: I have vastly <a href="https://x.com/Aella_Girl/status/1874602104972828920" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more sex than Aella</a>, who is famous for being a whore. If even <em>Aella</em> isn&#39;t getting laid enough, what hope is there for normal people? How do we <em>increase the fuck rate</em> for the masses? I think the answer is depressingly simple: most people don&#39;t have more sex because the sex they do have is mediocre at best. They settle for &quot;good enough&quot; and stop looking for better, stop trying to <em>be</em> better. It&#39;s like someone declaring they don&#39;t like sushi after only eating gas station California rolls. So, to answer <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2005/05/why_dont_people.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tyler&#39;s question</a>: people don&#39;t have more sex because most sex is lame.</p><p>More on this, too, in a future essay.</p><h3 id="Imaginary-Barriers"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/02/25/the-harem-of-an-autist/#Imaginary-Barriers" class="headerlink" title="Imaginary Barriers"></a>Imaginary Barriers</h3><p><strong>Nice guys:</strong> a lot of people think you need to be a jerk to get laid, but that&#39;s just another fake social script. The truth is this: being &quot;nice&quot; from a position of weakness is dating kryptonite. Women can smell the desperation. But being genuinely kind from a position of confidence and abundance is incredibly attractive. The difference isn&#39;t in the behavior itself, but in the energy behind it. True kindness flows from having clear boundaries and standards, from being genuinely interested in someone&#39;s wellbeing and pleasure—not from being a pushover hoping to trade basic decency for sexual access.</p><p><strong>The power to say no:</strong></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/eigenrobot/status/1744415149983690876" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/eigen_sayingno.png" class="nofancybox"></a></p><p>One of the most liberating discoveries wasn&#39;t the sex, but realizing I could...say no to it. At some point I started waiting for the second date before getting physical—the connection was better, the sex more comfortable. But it resulted in the strange scenario of girls practically pleading to come back to my place on first dates. Women find it bizarre when you say &quot;no&quot; in that situation, it&#39;s just not in their script. They&#39;re so accustomed to men desperate to get their dick wet that when you flip the dynamic, it short-circuits their entire understanding of dating.</p><p>This whole pathetic dance of men begging for a crumb of sex, trying to push the girl to come back to his place while she resists and acts as a gatekeeper to sex, etc.—it&#39;s entirely a choice. A collective delusion that persists only because everyone keeps playing their assigned role. You can simply reject it.</p><p><strong>Abundance mindset:</strong> when I had 2-3 concurrent partners, I became extremely selective and rejected almost everyone I went out with. The psychological impact of abundance is to make you secure in your own judgments, to push up your standards to where they should be in the first place and stick with them. Scarcity creates artificial commitment to bad relationships. Abundance helps you realize that compatible partners aren&#39;t unicorns—they&#39;re just people you haven&#39;t met yet. And entering a serious relationship with the perspective and attitude that abundance bestows on you makes everything so much easier.</p><p><strong>Cold approach:</strong> the barrier I have not broken yet. I&#39;m too fucking terrified to cold approach women in public, yet at the same time, I&#39;ve had way more sex than friends who regularly chat up strangers. A friend casually mentioned hitting on a cute girl in a museum, talking to her for an hour, and then bailing unceremoniously, not knowing how to close the deal. The very thought of hitting on a stranger makes me sink into the floor, melting through the boards, my liquefied body dripping right into the third circle of Dante&#39;s hell, but I have infinitely (literally, divided by zero) more sex than he did at the time. This makes absolutely no sense and completely contradicts conventional wisdom about &quot;getting out there&quot;.</p><h3 id="Finding-Fluorescence"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/02/25/the-harem-of-an-autist/#Finding-Fluorescence" class="headerlink" title="Finding Fluorescence"></a>Finding Fluorescence</h3><p>Once sex becomes easy, it loses some of its mystique. I found myself having as much sex as I wanted, but it was a fleeting satisfaction that left me yearning for more. One of the notes in my dating journal, following a breakup, reads:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>All I&#39;m left with is a nostalgic longing for a future that never was.</p></div></blockquote><p>Maybe that&#39;s not such a bad thing. Getting your heart stomped when someone doesn&#39;t reciprocate your feelings is a special kind of hell, but it turned out to be a necessary step.</p><p>Last year, I wrote to myself:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>I&#39;m not looking for someone who ticks my boxes. I&#39;m after &quot;I can&#39;t believe you exist&quot;, I want to be amazed, I am after fluorescent effervescence and electric bolts running up my spine, I want to feel like I&#39;m on amphetamines 24/7, entirely incapable of sleeping, lose my job and end up in an early grave because of my romantic obsession.</p></div></blockquote><p>Perhaps my relationship standards had been set by reading too many Russian novels, but then, improbably, unbelievably, astonishingly, I found her! And while boatloads of casual sex was pretty damn good, it doesn&#39;t hold a candle to settling down in a loving, inspiring relationship with a fantastic partner.</p><p>But here&#39;s the thing: I don&#39;t think I could have found it, or been ready for it, without all the fucking around first. The experience, the confidence that comes from abundance, from knowing you can walk away, from having your pick of partners—it fundamentally changes how you interact with the world. Without experiencing the wrong relationships—the boring ones, the sexually charged but emotionally empty ones, the ones where you&#39;re more therapist than partner—you lack the contrast needed to recognize something extraordinary when it does appear.</p><p>This stuff often fucking hurts. There&#39;s a reason the Buddha thought desire was the root of all suffering. But you know what? <a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/02/03/the-alchemist-and-his-quicksilver/">Fuck the Buddha</a>. Some pain is worth having.</p><p>Sometimes I wonder if getting into all this so late in life was a mistake. Did those years of celibacy permanently rewire my brain? Did I miss some crucial developmental window? A <a href="https://twitter.com/alexeyguzey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">friend of mine</a> said that celibacy has already destroyed my psyche. But I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true, it&#39;s never too late to fall in love.</p><p>So, what&#39;s next? Back to the books, or happy-ever-after relationship wireheading? One thing about breaking through arbitrary limitations is that it leaves you facing real ones, like how to spend the few days you have left on the planet. Nobody knows what the future holds, but I&#39;m really happy with my life right now.</p><p><strong>Fin</strong></p><p>We&#39;re all role-playing, and most people don&#39;t realize that they can just switch roles. You can just choose to be whatever you want. You Can Just Do Stuff™. So here&#39;s the four-minute mile of Fucking: if you&#39;re a reasonably put-together guy in his mid-30s, you could be having threesomes with cute college students. You simply have to make the choice to do it, the barriers are all inside you. If you&#39;re actually handsome or successful, you can basically live like Leo in perpetuity, though you&#39;ll probably get bored of it faster than he does.</p><p>But even if that&#39;s not what you want, I still recommend making sex <em>your</em> autistic special interest for a year or two. Not just for the obvious benefits, but because it opens up new mental and emotional states, teaches you surprising things about how people work, and most importantly, lets you enter a serious relationship knowing exactly what you want and what you&#39;re worth. And then you can make an informed decision: do I want to go monk mode, or full Simon Sarris? (Those are the only legitimate options).</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>To burn always with this hard, gemlike flame, to maintain this ecstasy, is success in life.</p></div></blockquote><p>We are going around the table on new year&#39;s eve, rating our past year on a scale of 1 to 10. The guests: artists, fashion designers, jewelers, and one or two people with real jobs sprinkled in for diversity. Two immaculately groomed poodles run around and entertain the visitors. Before us, an exactingly curated procession of morsels: blini with salmon and caviar, black brioche with cured egg yolk and parmigiano foam, ravioli with pumpkin and cod with browned butter and crispy sage. The apartment, naturally, is luxurious without being gauche (that would be unforgivable) every piece selected with impeccable taste and just the right amount of personal touch. And so we rate our years, the numbers start coming out, and it is a parade of 2s and 3s, each delivered with a sort of practiced <em>weltschmerz</em>. One of the guests plans to commit suicide soon. The only 10 in the room: me. Is it because I&#39;ve been perfectly happy, carefree? No—not quite.</p><p>I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about this lately, about my relationship with suffering. All this pain in the past few months, I think most people would recoil from it. Instead, I&#39;m drawn towards it. Is it psychological masochism? The intensity of emotion—it makes me feel alive, present, it gives me a heightened awareness of everything, inside and out.</p><p>I compulsively play with the pain in my mind: my thoughts trace its edges like fingers mapping an unknown shape in the dark; I run my mind over its surface to feel its texture, sometimes sharpcutting, sometimes soft and dull; I press against it, and see how it reacts; I savor it, let it melt in my mouth and glory in its bitterness; I feel the heat radiating from it like the dying embers of a fire late at night, and other times like x-rays blasting out of a black hole; I spin it around examining it from each and every angle one by one, appreciating its style from every point of view; I push it far away and look at it with a telescope to admire its entire structure, and then bring it right up to me and inspect every microscopic little element on its surface, and then sometimes I dive in and give myself over to it and let it envelop me and permeate my whole being until I feel and perceive nothing else and time stops completely.</p><p>(And sometimes I will take a good look at myself as though I were a case study: &quot;Subject displays strong tendencies toward self-dramatization, perpetually overthinking and rationalizing their emotions through baroque metaphors.&quot;)</p><p>I am even amused and entertained by it. I laugh at my life and these surprising and delightful and wretchedly dark alleyways it&#39;s leading me down. A dull psychiatrist would say it&#39;s nothing more than a defense mechanism. I don&#39;t believe that at all. This is not about protecting myself or &quot;processing&quot;. It&#39;s &quot;saying Yes to life even in its strangest and hardest problems&quot;—not to be liberated from terror and pity, but &quot;in order to be oneself the eternal joy of becoming&quot;. There is a kind of distance there, but it&#39;s not a detachment, it is rather a doubling of perception. It&#39;s a way of transmuting things. It&#39;s not that the pain becomes less real or less painful—it becomes <em>more</em> real, <em>more</em> vibrant, <em>more</em> itself—but it also becomes something else simultaneously.</p><p>To treat reality as a medium, to live life with the texture of a novel—this is part of the bargain of being me: simultaneously the author and his character. The paradox: rather than dulling your emotions, this splitting of consciousness instead makes everything more vivid. Like adding a mirror to a mirror and creating—infinity. When you view yourself from the third person, as someone whose life you are sketching out, every powerful emotion is a delight. And it&#39;s not just pain that works this way—joy, too, takes on this double character, I&#39;m swept up in it while also watching myself being swept up, and somehow the watching makes the feeling more intense rather than less. I am both the alchemist and his quicksilver, the sculptor and the clay, <a href="https://img.rss.com/the-antifada/800/cover_af0cba9447ae436aa637d6450bacb33d.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>creature and creator</em></a>.</p><p>I love my life — <em>aesthetically</em>.</p><p>It&#39;s not a mechanical collecting of experiences to dissect on a couch or on the page. Baudelaire writes of the artist-dandy as &quot;a man possessing at every moment the genius of childhood, in other words a genius for whom no edge of life is blunted.&quot; Not &quot;making meaning&quot; after the fact, but in the experience of every moment. A perpetual state of creative tension, of <em>becoming</em> and <em>self-overcoming</em>.</p><p>That is―<em>Anti-Buddhism</em>. Self-examination not to feel less, but to feel <em>more</em>. Not to avoid suffering, but to <em>glory in life</em>. Not to detach but to <em>overcome</em>. Not to escape, but to <em>revel</em> in life! Not to transcend, but to <em>heighten</em>. Cultivating not detachment, but <em>intensity</em> and <em>sensitivity</em>, with a poet&#39;s intentionality, making the self into an artist in the joy of its own eternal becoming. Creating a layer of aesthetic appreciation that runs parallel to the raw experience, and shapes it. Saying <em>No!</em> to the inhuman, life-denying ascetic nihilism of seeking &quot;liberation&quot; from attachment and suffering, <em>No!</em> to the <a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2022/10/10/against-effective-altruism/"><em>naiveties about pleasure and pain</em></a> that constitute this intellectual morass that surrounds us.</p><p>Everywhere people seek to smooth life&#39;s edges. Instead of riding its violent waves, they seek to transform them into a tepid swimming pool suitable for gentle laps without the least chance of drowning. They cling desperately onto old religions when they talk about enlightenment but mean only quietude, when they preach transcendence but mean only escape. What petty bargains with existence! This is not wisdom, but cowardice masquerading as enlightenment. They seek to tame, diminish, and bridle everything that should be wild! What is this if not a rejection of life itself? Life, which knows nothing of balance but only of tension, nothing of peace but only of creative strife! What sickness entices you to paddle in the shallows instead of making infinite demands on life and always finding yourself in some new wilderness? For &quot;life consists with wildness, and the most alive is the wildest.&quot;</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>The discipline of suffering, of <em>great</em> suffering – do you not know that it is <em>this</em> discipline alone which has created every elevation of mankind hitherto? That tension of the soul in misfortune which cultivates its strength, its terror at the sight of great destruction, its inventiveness and bravery in undergoing, enduring, interpreting, exploiting misfortune, and whatever of depth, mystery, mask, spirit, cunning and greatness has been bestowed upon it – has it not been bestowed through suffering, through the discipline of great suffering?</p></div></blockquote><p>I used to view the <em>tortured artist</em> with both envy and skepticism. It was a Romantic idea that I thought I wanted, while at the same time dismissing it as an affectation, a trope, a false source of inspiration, or perhaps just a tool to seduce women with. Sour grapes, I suppose. Now I have become him (inadvertently? or by design?) and the view from the inside is not quite what I was expecting...it is both more silly and more real than I thought it&#39;d be. There is certainly an absurd theater to it all. But the authenticity lies precisely in embracing the sublime <em>and</em> the ridiculous, in realizing that the real thing is both more serious and more playful than the cliché suggests. But it&#39;s not about turning pain into art, it&#39;s this splitting of consciousness that makes the darkest moments shimmer with beauty. Pain is not raw material to be processed later—it&#39;s already art in the moment of perception, if you&#39;ve developed the right kind of vision. &quot;Art from pain&quot; is shallow, I am talking about a methodology of life and consciousness: <em>Amor fati</em>!</p><p><em>The great sickness of our age</em>: the belief that life is something to be managed rather than a drama to be enacted.</p><p>Anyway, this is all a bit melodramatic if not pretentious...</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>—A wonderful piece.</p>]]></content>

Cărtărescu is a great stylist. Filled with surreal episodes in the liminal space between the droll ordinary life of late communist Romania and an incredible psychedelic fantasy world. People protest against death and have sex while levitating in the air, abandoned factories hide fantastical secrets. About writing, literature, art, humanity, dreams, death, life, love, bureaucracy. Nihilism and its defeat. Very wide array of influences, including H. P. Lovecraft, Jorge Luis Borges, all the Latin American magical realists as well as Bulgakov, Bolano, Pynchon, Dylan Thomas, Franz Kafka, even Cronenberg.</p><br><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>We search like idiots, we look in places where there is nothing to find, like spiders that weave webs in the corner of a bathroom where flies don’t come, where not even mosquitos can reach. We shrivel in our webs by the thousands, but what doesn’t die is our need for truth. We are like people drawn inside of a square on a piece of paper. We cannot get out of the black lines, we exhaust ourselves by examining, dozens and hundreds of times, every part of the square, hoping to find a fissure. Until one of us suddenly understands, because he was predestined to understand, that within the plane of the paper escape is impossible. That the exit, simple and open wide, is perpendicular to the paper, in a third dimension that up until that moment was inconceivable. Such that, to the amazement of those still inside the four ink lines, the chosen one breaks out of his chrysalis, spreads his enormous wings, and rises gently, leaving his shadow below in his former world.</p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/bb24_mediterranean.jpg" class="floatright nofancybox"><p>Fernand Braudel, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mediterranean-World-Age-Philip-II/dp/0520400658?crid=2EMWJ2OXH68D7&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Yw3ePswU37kOCDJgVvS8ubVk0S8flb_nAbidHP4ycjYgvWP3zwB-_cobfdEUrwCBqPkGY66xnbxH5j3dPcoVA-YMih4HemrJK3_sgwiksXG9whGUOrNe4Cwi5zvMiZexfJ3sAGI3u35hk855v-nMLLR1Jc_INg5G0kvnBMG5I4Wy3MyppGgdDjn2XfLUxQNgzIPiANt8l_a3z7nqJq7Nrda_vE_P6BCAVkyx_zz6MFo.jheeAPci-J4TzJWV1349SxIjij4PWhUi0475TyvNk98&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Mediterranean+and+the+Mediterranean+World+in+the+Age+of+Philip+II&qid=1737661639&sprefix=the+mediterranean+and+the+mediterranean+world+in+the+age+of+philip+ii%2Caps%2C392&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=4da162574e27eeed549ee787a5ba896a&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II</strong></a></p><p>Not quite as strong as Civilization &amp; Capitalism, but it&#39;s a brilliant work, the result of decades of painstaking research. The Braudelian world-view is felt on every page, the interlocking systems of trade, production, geography, crops, animals and people. Mountains shape trade routes, climate patterns determine harvests, sea currents guide merchants - everything connects to everything else in Braudel&#39;s Mediterranean. Written in a Nazi POW camp, it brought a fresh perspective on how to think about history: not kings and battles, but the slow dance of geography and climate, the rhythms of peasant life, the endless circulation of ships and goods. Immensely ambitious and beautifully written.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>But we cannot hope for precise measurements; at most we shall discover an order of magnitude. In this respect the Mediterranean was still broadly speaking the same size in the sixteenth century as it had been in Roman times, that is, over a thousand years earlier. Or to put it another way, the Mediterranean in the sixteenth century was comparable, mutatis mutandis, to the entire globe in 1939. It was vast, immeasurable, and its reputation as a &#39;human&#39; area was earned only by contrast with those other monsters which sixteenth-century man was just beginning to tackle - the Atlantic Ocean, not to mention the Pacific. These were truly monsters, alongside which the Mediterranean was more like a domestic animal, but certainly not the &#39;lake&#39; it has become in the twentieth century, the sunny resort of tourists and yachts where one can always reach land within a few hours and along whose length the traveller could be transported in the Orient Express. To understand what it was like in the sixteenth century, one must mentally magnify its area to a maximum and draw on remembered images from travellers&#39; tales of the days when months, years, even a whole lifetime, could be spent on a voyage.</p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/bb24_suttree.jpg" class="floatleft nofancybox"><p>Cormac McCarthy, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Suttree-Cormac-McCarthy/dp/0679736328?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.oosrep83q9Uudok2J2r8OpEu3xjehAzasMW-EnoD3p6gZ_qhNODqHyAnRCpsd75JJtt1aSnhNhhVNuFfhAEW12u7Zi8YF71its9-9IOmmDsi-rAUwvsuSMjs8PKhgY_pCTFNsV5U2qlvUH9IYhOHy7al7s_Jc9snaaq0Z22OF_9JHdwCKPnckO2c9uE5ziu4DI4FJGUBvlxcpvmbTfeQhHpd4raxwNu2UOWDnF67oB8.vq0Ck12z-3I4O9X7koNc9DXp8nHjqFEb_366VwR0Phk&dib_tag=se&keywords=Suttree&qid=1737661670&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=2ce749dbcf217d327313ab3bdbf1b686&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Suttree</strong></a></p><p>Basically nothing happens in this book, and it is absolutely spectacular. Non-stop linguistic fireworks. A masterpiece. Outcasts, drifters, hobos, and various other miscreants in 1950s Knoxville.

Funny and human, no Judges or cosmic pain here.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Dim scenes pooling in the summer night, wan ink wash of junks tilting against a paper sky, rorschach boatmen poling mutely over a mooncobbled sea.</p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/bb24_themaniac.jpg" class="floatright nofancybox"><p>Benjamin Labatut, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MANIAC-Benjamin-Labatut/dp/0593654498?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.5NwvY3c8hB7YcP1_AF9d8j0tgRfjiIg6PF3EYS7Tf7nVvAC5v-Lj1s_jfIVt21KKy6bTakRa8AUMB22VF_98msHMSoj8zMMxTmQH56IEO4fFYn67PVQYkNrkwyQDPj4D7E4FJBO31k-r01lEL_wgYKQbMTaHe4axmnYArQp_JSq8JFDiZmytROFgxuxhYlaCNrwvKHNMF48Ox1lI_6fNMDzuXnTHDEgWV912qpQ3wOc.WGNmhjtNz_C99WlCoWeU3z8nZMGD4k2zcM8Hcow4Uag&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+MANIAC&qid=1737661703&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=5936bc603949678bbf54701277e82e26&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>The MANIAC</strong></a></p><p>The book is split in two portions: first, a semi-fictionalized biography of von Neumann, with each chapter being told from the perspective of the people who knew him (his mother, brother, wife, scientific collaborators, etc). It doesn&#39;t focus strongly on the science, more on the person and his relations, and the recurring theme is one of petty resentment and inability to understand von Neumann because he was simply so far above and ahead of everyone else around him. The resentment often manifests as a kind of petty moralism, and Labatut basically makes everyone in von Neumann&#39;s life look rather pathetic. I don&#39;t know how factual that is, but it certainly works as a literary device.</p><p>The second part concerns Lee Sedol and AlphaGo. It&#39;s a bit drawn out, but it&#39;s an exciting story that&#39;s well-told. The point is essentially to underscore just how much von Neumann could see 60+ years ago, when everyone around him was essentially blind. AlphaGo is to the greatest humans as von Neumann is to normal ones -- we should expect the relations to play out in a similar way in both cases.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>I have known a great many intelligent people in my life. I knew Planck, von Laue, and Heisenberg. Paul Dirac was my brother-in-law, Leo Szilard and Edward Teller have been among my closest friends, and Albert Einstein was a good friend too. But none of them had a mind as quick and acute as Janos von Neumann. I remarked on this in the presence of those men, several times, and no one ever disputed me. Only he was fully awake.</p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/bb24_dickinson.jpg" class="floatleft nofancybox"><p>Emily Dickinson, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Selected-Poems-Dickinson-Timeless-Classics/dp/1631068415?crid=3EWY0JFFJTA7Z&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.kPvcqCIHR-PB8A4UQaktIHE54ZDiMIyvA4H0cWSCZYEknVDjzuIKR6jT4rQdVNVJ_w7SYhcqsDNo_QYae5J8LEq3jM-lsCMTEW_xL2pknqfdk-jEd3Ltnd18cN8hEn8GMlXi2br9wg-gfxe8IQOJFOOaGePvNuY70h_yxW_1JMOnXLyVndhnRtMcg0ezH_zAmxpS28W0xLYMWZOvTpU2NzD2jCbxEzT8o8XloPfxjp0.Yl_-Xnz8vDVMqF4eKqZFvPqRlFASc7Y_fm2BJlgRw2M&dib_tag=se&keywords=dickinson+Selected+Poems&qid=1737661731&sprefix=dickinson%2Caps%2C457&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=48819dcc4407be748b946bd624910ea5&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Selected Poems</a></strong></p><p>Deceptively simple, philosophical, dark, ecstatic.

Raw, intimate, with complete lack of dignity, it felt like an invasion of her privacy. Living life novelistically. How lovers really only exist in our minds. I think the essential, unique part of the story is that there is no attempt at justification, explanation, etc. She accepts and presents the bare facts about herself, and almost nothing about her lover. In a way this is a portrayal of incredibly deep passion, on the other hand her approach also makes it feel really shallow: he&#39;s handsome, drives a fast car, career-minded. We have absolutely no clue what her passion is for exactly, but that&#39;s exactly the point, that the reason of the passion is irrelevant or unknowable or inexplicable or not worth explaining, what really matters is her own experience and what she takes from it (&quot;I do not wish to explain my passion—that would imply that it was a mistake or some disorder I need to justify—I just want to describe it.&quot; and &quot;Whether or not he was “worth it” is of no consequence.&quot;) She considers herself luckier than him because she has the obsession and he does not, that really stood out as the cornerstone of the whole thing.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>When he rang to arrange a meeting, his long-awaited call had no effect on me and I remained locked in the same state of anxiety as before. My condition was such that not even the sound of his voice could make me happy. It was all infinite emptiness, except when we were together making love. And even then I dreaded the moments to come, when he would be gone. I experienced pleasure like a future pain. I longed to end the affair, so as not to be at the mercy of a phone call, so as not to suffer, realizing at once what this would entail, seconds after the separation: a series of days with nothing to wait for. I preferred to carry on at any cost—let him have another woman, or even several. (In other words, accepting a torment far greater than the one that made me want to leave him.) Compared to such emptiness, my present situation seemed enviable and my jealousy a sort of frail privilege which I would have been mad to want to end since one day it would end anyway, outside my control, when he would leave the country or would decide to stop seeing me.</p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/bb24_fragnemt.jpg" class="floatleft nofancybox"><p>Ctrlcreep, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fragnemt-ctrlcreep/dp/1795354437?crid=9HSHCLOGZPG2&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Prk6XNrVplhXtvdiykMQ6Q._KWCiiz9KrSwxp3T1Qk8kJ54JmaUVbMNXX05aWMRWQo&dib_tag=se&keywords=ctrl+creep&qid=1737661859&sprefix=ctrlcre%2Caps%2C184&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=f52f2f60f2d0f4552eedfe9b53832600&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fragnemt</a></strong></p><p>A collection of tweets and very short stories from @ctrlcreep. &quot;Why would I want to own a collection of tweets&quot;, you might think, but these are brilliantly etched little gems: dense, fantastical, inventive, awe-inspiring and terrifying.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>The forest&#39;s immortal animals are weary of life.

Intellectual and spiritual crisis; despair; isolation in bourgeois society. Both the protagonist (<strong>H</strong>enry <strong>H</strong>aller) and the manic pixie dream girl Hermine are essentially Hesse self-inserts. Sex, drugs, jazz, liberation from the shackles of over-thinking, transcendence. Written in the 1920s, but parts of it feel straight out of 60s psychedelic culture (especially the hallucinatory magic theater section). A perennial favorite with intellectual misfits for a reason.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>But, when he was a wolf, the man in him lay in ambush, ever on the watch to interfere and condemn, while at those times that he was man the wolf did just the same. For example, if Harry, as man, had a beautiful thought, felt a fine and noble emotion, or performed a so-called good act, then the wolf bared his teeth at him and laughed and showed him with bitter scorn how laughable this whole pantomime was in the eyes of a beast, of a wolf who knew well enough in his heart what suited him, namely, to trot alone over the Steppes and now and then to gorge himself with blood or to pursue a female wolf. Then, wolfishly seen, all human activities became horribly absurd and misplaced, stupid and vain. But it was exactly the same when Harry felt and behaved as a wolf and showed others his teeth and felt hatred and enmity against all human beings and their lying and degenerate manners and customs. For then the human part of him lay in ambush and watched the wolf, called him brute and beast, and spoiled and embittered for him all pleasure in his simple and healthy and wild wolf’s being.</p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/bb24_sexualpersonae.jpg" class="floatleft nofancybox"><p>Camille Pagile, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sexual-Personae-Decadence-Nefertiti-Dickinson/dp/0679735798?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ygXSpHvB-Cl2ENJtjShFAapIiX1G34t-fj4xLJdkR4g6UVUckPpqv49sM_5j8nFO1MzJqD0eKFuzTmknW7UCWDkxWAsMTdedrSe7dEhqEJ5SuWsApwK5oRmO7JTwgf5Ff7pYffRByTf34l8ngnkjUOJCqaJrxY6qkP5N7zBcLyeqT6lr4HPJSS6S6G-7vS-trTuUtz9CW1dnsC1bDpDRT7qUB-zfeHaktObqFeorvVk.egFSWebZZvvoytTSdJYha55Qjh0y0f3DSCWzkHhj3T0&dib_tag=se&keywords=Sexual+Personae&qid=1737661927&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=71550ed434e14464f3804cadd3e1e15b&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sexual Personae</a></strong></p><p>Paglia said this book &quot;was intended to please no one and to offend everyone.&quot; It&#39;s not quite as offensive today, 35 years after its original publication, but it still manages to maintain a sharp edge.

Sex, decadence, Apollo vs Dionysus. Bombastic and aphoristic. It&#39;s a bit too long, and the energy of the first few hundred pages isn&#39;t maintained to the end, but well worth experiencing.

The drive, the vision, the creative power, the collaborations, and the endless series of insane situations he put and found himself in make the whole thing feel fictional.

The monkeys had been sitting in Iquitos for weeks, but when it came to actually having to use them for the scene it turned out they had all been sold to an American businessman and were already on a plane waiting to go to the US. We ran to the airport and insisted we were veterinarians and that we had to see the vac- cination papers for the animals. We shouted so loudly that they admitted they had no papers, and they embarrassedly unloaded the animals from the plane. We just put them into our truck and left. When it actually came to shooting the sequence, the monkeys had some kind of a panic attack and bit me all over. I could not cry out because we were shooting live sound at that point.</p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/bb24_penalcolony.jpg" class="floatleft nofancybox"><p>Franz Kafka, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Metamorphosis-Penal-Colony-Other-Stories/dp/0684800705?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.M8EPAaOsJZeYzlcM-XBukx5vJpfVdtVJCary4Jflph120YVuQfgx_lVppSYb9HfYzM-ylzac0GIiyn2A6HXJTfbSwShE0C_qg3DCvr42Bj_4NRtfSKHvaMkDpensiWTNQKjpc_yMgOlfJ8gbepTWUBadGgx0aEjTXdT7u-AMgU9goLW0g0sWmDO82ox3_XsvXOQbistmrxASvLClmeb8WewRALFjP4v5k9Bv2_lA_OY.Hq2yHquY9mcX48WsDiqbC9qKKnTw8ab-USTRJrU8drk&dib_tag=se&keywords=In+the+Penal+Colony&qid=1737661981&sr=8-4&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=0cc4812cba7c63d8034592c93fc772e9&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In the Penal Colony</a></strong></p><p>Kafka&#39;s best short work.

In the coming years, the editors of Presença would repeatedly invoke sincerity of expression and trueness to one’s self as hallmarks of superior art, while Pessoa would repeatedly question whether words such as sincerity and trueness can signify anything useful for a creative artist.</p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><h1 id="The-Worst"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/01/27/the-best-and-worst-books-i-read-in-2023-2024/#The-Worst" class="headerlink" title="The Worst"></a>The Worst</h1><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/bb24_longtwentiethcentury.jpg" class="floatleft nofancybox"><p>Giovanni Arrighi, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Long-Twentieth-Century-Money-Origins/dp/1844673049?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.wd85k4lrjnhOUtXw_PzqeOA2DMcC61msxpVB582TVqH6IUp2zbeUA0euBnwOUHzcmOf5r2THHxIOnpSB6Pb5kFpEyBHcRcbx4EEJB69n2RRCYeuDuKJr710VoKGVE9h_zcBq7lcCxNGyBh2RHBc0i8KdllBx_BMxWObQDylY8sK90UFxJojeJbJbLMivaAu89R1WQOJoTMRxVFxWltmor5KWaFAQzmG5ks0qRVLKv_4.sBhP-fqG0hEXg7Md20KkSOehqdJfnBzUAXUD9wRTiAY&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Long+Twentieth+Century&qid=1737662007&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=1702817f82cfb3505c23868a58129b79&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Long Twentieth Century</a></strong></p><p>Utterly irredeemable garbage.</p><p>This was sold to me as a kind of sequel to Braudel&#39;s Civilization &amp; Capitalism, one of my favorite books.

He displays none of the curiosity, none of the interest in data (while Braudel&#39;s work is filled with numbers, it would not surprise me if Arrighi was innumerate). But he does share Braudel&#39;s attitude towards growth (which is to say that he ignores it).

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Perhaps if we lived on a crest, things would be different. We could at least see.</p></div></blockquote><p>A <em>pleb filter</em> is a piece of art which, by virtue of its impenetrability, &quot;filters out&quot; people with bad taste. What makes the pleb filter such an entertaining addition to online Discourse is that it&#39;s a ready-made kafkatrap, a perfect concept for trolls and shitposters to weaponize: once an artwork has been declared a &quot;pleb filter&quot;—no matter how absurd the claim—any disagreement instantly labels you an unsophisticated rube, a pleb who has been <em>filtered</em>.</p><p>Thus one may find oneself in futile internet conversations trying desperately to explain that, no, <em>Ishtar</em> really is quite bad, that Ringo is not the best Beatle, and that Joel Schumacher&#39;s nipple-Batman is <em>not</em> actually a sublime work of misunderstood cinematic genius. The troll choices are virtually infinite, but work best when applied to creations that are universally agreed to be terrible: the prequels, <em>St. Anger</em>, or the <em>oeuvre</em> of 6ix9ine.</p><p>There are fake filters, like Tarr&#39;s <em>Werckmeister Hamornies</em>—art which tries to be challenging and hints at great depths while actually being quite shallow. A picture of a pool drawn on a piece of paper, and often frustrating because they are a pleb&#39;s idea of a pleb filter. Still, some (like <em>The Magus</em> or <em>The Recognitions</em>) have their charms.</p><p>Finally we have the actual pleb filters, works which are both brilliant and inaccessible. <em>Trout Mask Replica</em>, Michael Mann&#39;s <em>Miami Vice</em>, <em>Faust Part Two</em>, <em>Enter the Void</em>, the <em>Paradiso</em>, Season 2 of <em>True Detective</em>, <em>Fanged Noumena</em>, the <em>Iliad&#39;s</em> catalogue of ships.</p><h2 id="The-IQ-of-Shitposters"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2023/02/06/on-the-pleb-filter/#The-IQ-of-Shitposters" class="headerlink" title="The IQ of Shitposters"></a>The IQ of Shitposters</h2><p>To proclaim the genius of <em>Hamlet</em> is commonplace; to successfully defend <em>The Two Gentlemen of Verona</em> as Shakespeare&#39;s greatest play takes some <em>serious intellectual firepower</em>. Defending the indefensible is a great signal of brainpower: a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/14747049211000317" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent study</a> finds that &quot;bullshit ability is associated with an individual’s intelligence and individuals capable of producing more satisfying bullshit are judged by second-hand observers to be more intelligent&quot;. The pleb filter is not just a fun tool for trolling, it also offers a great opportunity to show off one&#39;s smarts.</p><p>It is genuinely challenging to truly appreciate the talent and artistry that goes into bullshit—Armond White (perhaps the greatest bullshitter of our time) is himself a pleb filter, perhaps the ultimate one. Some are liable to react with horror, but I think it&#39;s a game worth indulging in.</p><p>At the same time, there&#39;s a countersignaling game being played. On the <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/22/right-is-the-new-left/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">barber pole</a> of intellectual status, the highbrow will adopt lowbrow tastes in order to signal that they&#39;re not midwits. Thus we get <a href="https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/https://doi.org/10.1093/jcr/ucz049" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fancy restaurants serving mac and cheese</a>, and big-brained shitposters defending <em>Showgirls</em>. It is no coincidence that the very idea of the pleb filter was invented on a website whose users are famous for being very smart and pretending to be very stupid.</p><p>Sometimes isolated communities spiral local status markers into overdrive, creating unintentional bad pleb filters, with wild signaling and counter-signaling battles cascading downwards, leaving outside onlookers utterly bewildered. The famously unintelligible world of high fashion offers a memorable, and sometimes beautiful, instance of this phenomenon.</p><h2 id="Criticism-and-the-Anxiety-of-the-Filter"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2023/02/06/on-the-pleb-filter/#Criticism-and-the-Anxiety-of-the-Filter" class="headerlink" title="Criticism and the Anxiety of the Filter"></a>Criticism and the Anxiety of the Filter</h2><p>The pleb filter is also a formidable force in the realm of art criticism: the critic must always maintain a position of superiority over his audience, for it is this stance which gives him the authority to dictate what is good or bad. He must therefore never be filtered, and even more importantly never <em>appear</em> to be filtered. Thus he will praise formulaic &quot;high culture&quot; garbage, lest he be mistaken for someone who doesn&#39;t <em>get it</em>.</p><p>When a critic encounters a work that eludes his understanding, something that may surpass his grasp, the anxiety of being filtered becomes <em>palpable</em>—and he often reacts to such works in an extreme way by denigrating them. This is why so many of the great classics were initially met with unfavorable reviews: <em>The Thing</em>, <em>Moby-Dick</em>, <em>Lolita</em>, half of Kubrick&#39;s movies. <em>Chimes at Midnight</em>, Orson Welles&#39;s best film, was savaged when it came out and barely got distribution due to the terrible advance reviews. The anxiety of the filter is to the critic what the anxiety of influence is to the artist.</p><h2 id="The-Case-of-Michael-Thomas-Green"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2023/02/06/on-the-pleb-filter/#The-Case-of-Michael-Thomas-Green" class="headerlink" title="The Case of Michael Thomas Green"></a>The Case of Michael Thomas Green</h2><p>The most interesting pleb filters are those that lie exactly on the line between being a troll pleb filter and a real pleb filter: <em>Speed Racer</em>, <em>Love Exposure</em>, the <em>Book of Numbers</em>, the <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> series, perhaps <em>Dhalgren</em>—works where powerful arguments can be made in both directions, works stuck in the limbo between stupidity and genius. Who can forget the iconic image of Sean Connery in the red trunks from <em>Zardoz</em>? There&#39;s a particular form of failure that is borne of great ambition. Take <em>Southland Tales</em>, for example, an utterly bizarre work of deranged grandeur. It is bad <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7YXONuF3dk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beyond belief</a>. And yet there&#39;s something there, something alluring, something that pulls you in and props you up and keeps you watching.</p><p>In 2001, Tom Green wrote, directed, and starred in <em>Freddy Got Fingered</em>, a stupid yet brilliantly fearless comedy about a failed cartoonist and his relationship with his family. The critics hated it, filling their reviews with adjectives like &quot;embarrassing&quot;, &quot;witless&quot;, &quot;vile&quot;, and &quot;sad&quot;, but the film maintains a dedicated following to this day. Some have described it as a surrealist masterpiece, others as a $14 million dollar prank on a movie studio, others as a film before its time. Nathan Rabin writes that &quot;studios exist precisely to keep films this audacious, original, and transgressive from ever hitting theaters&quot;, while <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v_wfECtCvQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lindsay Ellis</a> calls Green &quot;the Orson Welles of our time&quot; and describes <em>Freddy</em> as a film of pure insight into the soul of its creator and a &quot;dadaist masterpiece&quot;.</p><p><em>Freddy</em> offers a perfect example of the anxiety of the filter: Ebert gave it zero stars, but in his infamous review he compares Tom Green to Buñuel, and declares that &quot;the day may come when &quot;Freddy Got Fingered&quot; is seen as a milestone of neo-surrealism.&quot; 16 months after his initial review, Ebert was still thinking about the inscrutable genius of <em>Freddy</em>, writing in his review of <em>Stealing Harvard</em>:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Seeing Tom Green reminded me, as how could it not, of his movie Freddy Got Fingered, which was so poorly received by the film critics that it received only one lonely, apologetic positive review on the Tomatometer. I gave it—let&#39;s see—zero stars. Bad movie, especially the scene where Green was whirling the newborn infant around his head by its umbilical cord. But the thing is, I remember Freddy Got Fingered more than a year later. I refer to it sometimes. It is a milestone. And for all its sins, it was at least an ambitious movie, a go-for-broke attempt to accomplish something. It failed, but it has not left me convinced that Tom Green doesn&#39;t have good work in him. Anyone with his nerve and total lack of taste is sooner or later going to make a movie worth seeing.</p></div></blockquote><h2 id="Ἐγὼ-δ-̓οἶδα-μὲν-ὡς-αἱ-ὑπερμεγέθεις-φύσεις-ἥκιστα-καθαραί"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2023/02/06/on-the-pleb-filter/#Ἐγὼ-δ-̓οἶδα-μὲν-ὡς-αἱ-ὑπερμεγέθεις-φύσεις-ἥκιστα-καθαραί" class="headerlink" title="Ἐγὼ δ ̓οἶδα μὲν ὡς αἱ ὑπερμεγέθεις φύσεις ἥκιστα καθαραί"></a>Ἐγὼ δ ̓οἶδα μὲν ὡς αἱ ὑπερμεγέθεις φύσεις ἥκιστα καθαραί</h2><p>Longinus, in his essay <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/17957/17957-h/17957-h.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>On the Sublime</em></a>, observes that mediocre artists don&#39;t make mistakes: their works are faultless because they stay within convention and take no risks. Perfection is merely an artifact of insufficient ambition. Errour is the purview of the Great!</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Is it not by risking nothing, by never aiming high, that a writer of low or middling powers keeps generally clear of faults and secure of blame? Whereas the loftier walks of literature are by their very loftiness perilous? [...] Though I have myself noted not a few faulty passages in Homer and in other authors of the highest rank, and though I am far from being partial to their failings, nevertheless I would call them not so much wilful blunders as oversights which were allowed to pass unregarded through that contempt of little things, that “brave disorder,” which is natural to an exalted genius; and I still think that the greater excellences, though not everywhere equally sustained, ought always to be voted to the first place in literature, if for no other reason, for the mere grandeur of soul they reveal. [...] Would you rather be a Homer or an Apollonius?</p></div></blockquote><p>Bolaño plays with this notion in the famous passage on the bookish pharmacist, but I find the most striking echo of this idea is found in Flaubert&#39;s final novel, <em>Bouvard et Pécuchet</em>. He spent nearly a decade working on it, but did not manage to complete it before his death. It is a strange, repetitive work teetering on the brink between comedy and tragedy; ostensibly a work of social criticism, it is really about Flaubert looking inwardly. And it was a radical departure from anything that he (or anyone else) had written before. He writes in a letter:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>At times, the immense scope of this book stuns me. What will come of it? I only hope I’m not deceiving myself into writing something goofy rather than sublime. No, I think not! Something tells me I’m on the right path! But it will be one or the other.</p></div></blockquote><p>He even places some self-relferential meta-commentary on just this topic <em>within</em> the book—</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>He was assailed by doubts. For if mediocre minds (as Longinus observed) are incapable of faults, then faults are committed by the masters—and we should admire them? That’s too much!</p></div></blockquote><p>And for critics, it is exactly this ability to appreciate something great and flawed, as opposed to something small-souled and perfect, that separates the plebeian from the noble taste.</p><h2 id="We-Yearn-Nonetheless"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2023/02/06/on-the-pleb-filter/#We-Yearn-Nonetheless" class="headerlink" title="...We Yearn, Nonetheless..."></a>...We Yearn, Nonetheless...</h2><p>What unites these works in the interstice between the goofy and the sublime is a <em>reckless</em> ambition that goes against all standards of good taste, no not even <em>against</em> but <em>beyond</em>, powered by some unprincipled eruption of creative <em>élan</em>, and not due to some misguided contrarianism but because the old standards are simply incapable of containing the artist&#39;s vision which, pushing out against its own limits, bursts like a star. They are a dive off the edge, a rejection of any interpolation between known points, a heroic leap beyond the confines of the billion-dimensional <a href="https://twitter.com/alexeyguzey/status/1566865664962281472" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latent space of ideas</a>, riding exotic vectors into unknown territories, vectors invisible to to all but their discoverer—what Bolaño had in mind when he was writing about those &quot;great, imperfect, torrential works, books that blaze a path into the unknown&quot;.</p><p>Perhaps this ought to be our attitude not just toward our artistic creations, but also the sculpting of our life and character and <a href="https://twitter.com/literalbanana/status/712913395645685760" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even our beliefs</a>.</p><p>Great philosophers and artists have always endeavored to chart their own path, to avoid recapitulating the shackles of their social conditioning, to find new vantage points that will allow them to see farther and more clearly. Is this not what Plato was after when he sought out the Pythagoreans in Italy? Is this not what Herodotus was looking for when he was interviewing the sages of Egypt and the Scythians of the Don? Is this not what Nick Land was <em>reaching</em> for when he was &quot;lying on the ground, croaking into a mic while Mackay played jungle records in the background&quot;? It doesn&#39;t always work. But one must at least try.</p><p>&quot;There are two kinds of scientific progress,&quot; declares my old pal Prokhor, &quot;the methodical experimentation and categorization which gradually extend the boundaries of knowledge, and the revolutionary leap of genius which redefines and transcends those boundaries. Acknowledging our debt to the former, we yearn, nonetheless, for the latter.&quot; We yearn indeed, but what dear old Prokhor has omitted is that the leap is risky, and the risk usually fails to pay off.

    <updated>2023-01-31T05:17:50.001Z</updated>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the last decade there&#39;s been virtually endless discussion about the effects of austerity on the UK economy. The Guardian: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/03/lost-decade-hidden-story-how-austerity-broke-britain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The lost decade: the hidden story of how austerity broke Britain</a>. FT: <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e9fef496-7bd2-4bee-ac9b-e17359944eae" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Years of austerity are now writ large on the UK state</a>. NYT: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/24/world/europe/britain-austerity-may-budget.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What Is Austerity and How Has It Affected British Society?</a>. And just a few days ago David Wallace-Wells, discussing the country&#39;s growth problems, <a href="https://archive.is/e1Sfg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote that</a> &quot;the country’s obvious struggles have a very obvious central cause: austerity&quot;.</p><p>There&#39;s just a little problem with all of this: there was never any austerity in the UK. It&#39;s a pure media fabrication that persists only because nobody cares to look at the data.</p><p>So, let us bring out the charts! First of all, the UK has been running deficits for more than 20 years now. The deficits were huge even right in the middle of the supposedly austere period. Living beyond your means is not <em>austerity</em>, it&#39;s <em>profligacy</em>.</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/austerity_deficit.png"><p>What does Wallace-Wells say to justify his claims about &quot;austerity&quot;?</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>In the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, and in the name of rebalancing budgets, the Tory-led government set about cutting annual public spending, as a proportion of G.D.P., to 39 percent from 46 percent.</p></div></blockquote><p>This is technically true, but stupid. The 46% figure comes from the middle of the Global Financial Crisis, when GDP dropped by more than 15% and the government was trying to stimulate the economy. A decade later, spending as % of GDP had simply returned to its pre-recession level. This isn&#39;t &quot;austerity&quot;, it&#39;s just good old regular Keynesian countercyclical fiscal policy. In fact, the UK had already escaped from recession in 2010, and it continued to run huge deficits anyway.<span class="tooltip"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2023/01/31/the-myth-of-austerity-in-the-uk/#fn5166307721" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref5166307721">1</sup></a></span></p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/austerity_spendingpctgdp.png"><p>And to emphasize just how unsustainable this profligacy has been, the UK&#39;s debt-to-GDP ratio has gone from ~35% to ~100% during this period of &quot;austerity&quot;!</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/austerity_debttogdp.png"><p>Did spending ever actually go <em>down</em>? Nope:</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/austerity_spending.jpg"><p>&quot;But Alvaro, there were cuts to this one particular thing I care about, therefore there was austerity.&quot; Sure, spending has been moved around a bit; some areas have gotten more money and others less. As you&#39;d expect from an aging society,<span class="tooltip"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2023/01/31/the-myth-of-austerity-in-the-uk/#fn5166307722" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref5166307722">2</sup></a></span> the UK spends a lot more on healthcare these days than it did 20 years ago; this is just a natural shift in priorities, not austerity. Here&#39;s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/public-spending-statistics-release-may-2022/public-spending-statistics-may-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inflation-adjusted spending broken down by category</a>, straight from His Majesty&#39;s Treasury:<span class="tooltip"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2023/01/31/the-myth-of-austerity-in-the-uk/#fn5166307723" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref5166307723">3</sup></a></span></p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/austerity_realspending.jpg"><p>I would also add that despite the huge increase in healthcare spending, this is the one area that Wallace-Wells chooses to highlight in his article blaming austerity!</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>On average, English ambulances were taking an hour and a half to respond to stroke and heart-attack calls, compared with a target time of 18 minutes; nationwide, 10 times as many patients spent more than four hours waiting in emergency rooms as did in 2011. The waiting list for scheduled treatments recently passed seven million — more than 10 percent of the country — prompting nurses to strike. The National Health Service has been in crisis for years, but over the holidays, as wait times spiked, the crisis moved to the very center of a narrative of national decline.</p></div></blockquote><p>Despite this incredible profligacy, the effects of deficit spending on growth have clearly not been very successful—why then does Wallace-Wells expect that <em>yet more</em> profligacy would somehow avert national decline? The UK government and economy obviously have many problems; austerity is not one of them.</p><div id="footnotes"><hr><div id="footnotelist"><ol style="list-style:none;padding-left:0;margin-left:40px"><li id="fn5166307721"><span style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;padding-right:10px;margin-left:-40px">1.</span><span><span class="footnote-contents">You could make some output gap arguments for deficit spending here but whatever.</span><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2023/01/31/the-myth-of-austerity-in-the-uk/#fnref5166307721" rev="footnote"> ↩</a></span></li><li id="fn5166307722"><span style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;padding-right:10px;margin-left:-40px">2.</span><span><span class="footnote-contents">The median age in the UK has increased by ~6 years since the GFC; the elderly have gone from ~15% of the population to over 25%.</span><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2023/01/31/the-myth-of-austerity-in-the-uk/#fnref5166307722" rev="footnote"> ↩</a></span></li><li id="fn5166307723"><span style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;padding-right:10px;margin-left:-40px">3.</span><span><span class="footnote-contents">Note that the education figures are not comparable before and after 2011 due to a methodological change.</span><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2023/01/31/the-myth-of-austerity-in-the-uk/#fnref5166307723" rev="footnote"> ↩</a></span></li></ol></div></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="The-Best"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2023/01/23/the-best-and-worst-books-i-read-in-2022/#The-Best" class="headerlink" title="The Best"></a>The Best</h1><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/bb22_passenger.jpg" class="floatleft nofancybox"><p>Cormac McCarthy, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Passenger-Box-Set-Stella-Maris/dp/0593536045?keywords=the+passenger&qid=1672244673&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=f2464ae2e779922885489a536ce28c30&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Passenger/Stella Maris</a></strong></p><p>A salvage diver (Bobby <em>Western</em>) is sent to investigate a plane at the bottom of the ocean. Somehow the plane is intact and one of the passengers is missing. When he gets back, shadowy government agents are after him. Western is also a genius mathematician and a racing car driver. This is a potboiler!</p><p>On the other hand we have the deranged visions of his sister, in a Pynchonian absurdist mode. The thriller plotline is quickly abandoned, and the rest of the novel plays out mostly in a series of conversations. Mathematics, physics, the atomic bomb, JFK assassination conspiracy theories, the role of the unconscious: this is a novel of ideas in many ways. At the same time it&#39;s deeply romantic, filled to the brim with longing, regret, loss, and love. It&#39;s an incredibly sad book.</p><p>Overall this is a novel that strikes out in many directions, many times in unsatisfying and imprecise and undisciplined ways, but it somehow achieves an effect. &quot;Blaze paths into the unknown&quot; etc. To the usual McCarthyan mix of Hemingway and Captain Ahab, he now adds heavy doses of Pynchon and DeLillo.</p><p>Perhaps the passenger is the conscious, or the unconscious, or they&#39;re both passengers (probably all of the above).</p><p>The second novel is a series of conversations between Bobby&#39;s sister Alicia and her psychiatrist, a short time before she commits suicide. It&#39;s mostly a companion piece, and many times it feels like Alicia is McCarthy&#39;s mouthpiece. It&#39;s about mathematics and giving up mathematics and the foundation of mathematics, about language, about meaning in a godless world, about the inability to experience the world directly and the effects of various intermediation mechanisms (including language), about love and longing, about the burden of knowledge, about intelligence, evolution and evolutionary psychology, physics and the bomb and the sins of the father. Both books try their damnest to tackle Gnosticism.</p><p>One of the best works in many years, I can&#39;t wait to go back to it.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Here is a story. The last of all men who stands alone in the universe while it darkens about him. Who sorrows all things with a single sorrow. Out of the pitiable and exhausted remnants of what was once his soul he’ll find nothing from which to craft the least thing godlike to guide him in these last of days.</p></div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Cantor, Gauss, Riemann, Euler. Hilbert. Poincaré. Noether. Hypatia. Klein, Minkowski, Turing, von Neumann. Hardly even a partial list. Cauchy, Lie, Dedekind, Brouwer. Boole. Peano. Church is still alive. Hamilton, Laplace, Lagrange. The ancients of course. You look at these names and the work they represent and you realize that the annals of latterday literature and philosophy by comparison are barren beyond description.</p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/bb22_wolfe.jpg" class="floatright nofancybox"><p>Gene Wolfe, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Island-Doctor-Death-Other-Stories/dp/0312863543?keywords=The+Island+of+Doctor+Death+and+Other+Stories+and+Other+Stories&qid=1674480945&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=1164a9b19634e2e8e17d38a9793627bd&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Island of Doctor Death and Other Stories and Other Stories</a></strong></p><p>Slightly uneven but the best stories are really great: in particular I loved Feather Tigers, Death of Dr. Island, Toy Theater, and Seven American Nights. Loads of classic Wolfeian mindfuckery. Many of the stories are in that classic Wolfe style where you have to piece together what&#39;s going on from tiny hints left in the text, and it&#39;s all a bit ambiguous in the end and so on. There&#39;s a lot of focus on religion (often explicitly Christian) and death. Two stories, The Hero as Werwolf and The Doctor of Death Island, being fairly explicitly death-ist. Technology and its social effects, the problem of evil, mastery of art versus human relations, the hollowness of immortality, how people would react to a messianic figure, and more!</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>An exaggerated and solemn respect always indicates a loss of faith.</p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/bb22_tott.jpg" class="floatleft nofancybox"><p>François, Baron de Tott, <strong><a href="https://sylviaioannoufoundation.org/en/collection/digital-library/b0077/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Memoirs of the Baron De Tott, on the Turks and the Tartars</a></strong></p><p>A look into the past, from the past. Filled with fascinating little observations (I found the book through an anecdote about forks which Braudel mentions in C&amp;C). Roughly at the time the American revolution was happening, the same time when Johnson and Boswell were drinking too much claret at the Mitre, de Tott was joining the Crimean Tatars on a slave raid into Southern Russia. He spent many years in the Ottoman empire over two stints, and finally also traveled around the middle east. Most fascinating for its observations of Ottoman society, and the role de Tott played in the Russo-Turkish war of &#39;68-&#39;74. Somewhat niche, but definitely worth a read if this is your kind of thing.</p><p>What causes the fall of empires? Culture, Tott says: all decay ultimately comes from within. He&#39;s particular critical of the effects of despotism in government: everyone&#39;s place is precarious and there is no room for prosocial ambition. Simultaneously totally lawless but also extremely despotic—anarcho-tyranny at its finest, made worse by abitrary and capricious system of punishments.</p><p>Oh, and the introduction by the translator is absolutely hilarious (unintentionally).</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>How can so Sovereign a contempt for human nature amongst the Turks consist with that whimsical beneficence they display towards certain animals the most useless to fociety? Barbarity itself, no doubt, stands in need of some relaxation, whilst it crushes mankind under the weight of its iron secptre, it condescends to smile on objects whole insignificance give no occasion for alarm; and the pride of the despot blending all beings together in one common Contempt, selects its favourites from amongst the weakelt.</p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/bb22_sartorresartus.jpg" class="floatright nofancybox"><p>Thomas Carlyle, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sartor-Resartus-Oxford-Worlds-Classics/dp/0199540373?crid=3CAYQFX073Z2D&keywords=sartor+resartus&qid=1674480030&sprefix=sartor+%2Caps%2C1221&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=8944a6defa3899411f5b1ea2007f32e9&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sartor Resartus</a></strong></p><p>A review of a fictional philosophical tome on clothing, with various notes on the life of its author, the also fictional Diogenes Teufelsdröckh. Imagine a mix between Borges, Laurence Sterne, and Fichte. And it&#39;s got Carlyle&#39;s ridiculous style (which was extreme even in his own time) to top things off. And you can almost never tell when it&#39;s serious and when it&#39;s not. This book caused Emerson to start corresponding with Carlyle, and even inspired Borges to learn German!</p><p>In Sartor Resartus, only a lifelong quest for knowledge can lead one to the truth that knowledge is unattainable (or perhaps the other way around?). Carlyle hates the limiting effect of the standard philosophical approaches of his time, so he instead opts for this extreme type of illegible, non-linear anti-discourse in which everything is both deadly serious and potentially an ironic joke. What I&#39;m saying is that Carlyle was the first zoomer.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>The age of Curiosity, like that of Chivalry, is indeed, properly speaking, gone. Yet perhaps only gone to sleep: for here arises the Clothes-Philosophy to resuscitate, strangely enough, both the one and the other! Should sound views of this Science come to prevail, the essential nature of the British Dandy, and the mystic significance that lies in him, cannot always remain hidden under laughable and lamentable hallucination. The following long Extract from Professor Teufelsdröckh may set the matter, if not in its true light, yet in the way towards such. It is to be regretted however that, here as so often elsewhere, the Professor’s keen philosophic perspicacity is somewhat marred by a certain mixture of almost owlish purblindness, or else of some perverse, ineffectual, ironic tendency, our readers shall judge which</p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/bb22_nostromo.jpg" class="floatleft nofancybox"><p>Joseph Conrad, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nostromo-Tale-Seaboard-Penguin-Classics/dp/0141441631?crid=3LHKPA46F2I1W&keywords=Nostromo+conrad&qid=1665068938&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIzLjE2IiwicXNhIjoiMi42OCIsInFzcCI6IjIuOTMifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=nostromo+conr%2Caps%2C215&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=3cdbbaffe558157e7b3cf5afd4aeb9bf&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nostromo</a></strong></p><p>To say that it&#39;s about a dockworker would be both true and misleading. Nostromo is the dashing <em>Capataz de Cargadores</em>, a man obsessed with his image and driven to heroic tasks out of a desire to maintain it.</p><p>A chopped-up story from various points of view, the narrative is kaleidoscopically structured: fragmented, unclear, conflicting, and circular. Character motivations and world-views clash with each other as the fate of Costaguana is determined. Politics, heroism, revolt (internal and external), the worth of social status, reputations, perceptions, allegiances, and material vs idealistic interests. Betrayals of all kinds. Private and public vindications and redemptions. Great stuff.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>To be a millionaire, and such a millionaire as Holroyd, is like being eternally young. The audacity of youth reckons upon what it fancies an unlimited time at its disposal; but a millionaire has unlimited means in his hand—which is better.

A kind of nihilistic telos for all intellectual pursuits, with an alluring beauty all of its own. The actual game itself is never described; instead we follow the life of Joseph Knecht from student, to leader of the order, and the next steps after that, as he is torn between the real world and the ivory tower.</p><p>The Borges influence can be felt throughout, and there&#39;s nothing quite like it.</p><p>The life of the mind, asceticism, the lifecycle of organizations, hierarchies and servitude, purpose and nihilism, beauty, sacrifice, duty, transcendence.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Especially for young men with gifts like those of Joseph Knecht, who have not been driven by a single talent to concentrate on a specialty, but whose nature rather aims at integration, synthesis, and universality, this springtide of free study is often a period of intense happiness and very nearly of intoxication. Were it not preceded by the discipline of the elite schools, by the psychic hygiene of meditation exercises and the lenient supervision of the Board of Educators, this freedom would even be dangerous for such natures and might prove a nemesis to many, as it used to be to innumerable highly gifted young men in the ages before our present educational pattern was set, in the pre-Castalian centuries. The universities in those days literally swarmed with young Faustian spirits who embarked with all sails set upon the high seas of learning and academic freedom, and ran aground on all the shoals of untrammeled dilettantism. Faust himself, after all, was the prototype of brilliant amateurishness and its consequent tragedy.</p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/bb22_hhhh.jpg" class="floatleft nofancybox"><p>Laurent Binet, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/HHhH-Novel-Laurent-Binet/dp/1250033349?crid=1L0F2SXZLWTG8&keywords=hhhh&qid=1665069364&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIyLjk3IiwicXNhIjoiMS44OCIsInFzcCI6IjEuOTMifQ%3D%3D&s=books&sprefix=hhh%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C331&sr=1-1&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.006c50ae-5d4c-4777-9bc0-4513d670b6bc&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=fc3ef7e193cbe588aaceefd32b8f97f6&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HHhH</a></strong></p><p><em>Himmlers Hirn heißt Heydrich</em>. The story of Operation Anthropoid (to assassinate Reinhard Heydrich in Prague) and everything that led up to it. 257 short chapters, sometimes consisting of nothing more than a quotation. It&#39;s a blend of a mostly-historical retelling of the operation with a ton of metafictional elements on top. Binet constantly comments on the issues with constructing a historical novel, compares his approach to other books and movies, and even brings his personal life into it. Irony, humor, self-consciousness (especially about the author&#39;s view of Heydrich), the tension between history and fiction, and a slow, horrific build-up that absolutely fills you with terror. Incredible that this book can manage such a powerful emotional effect despite the ironic tone. The absurd scenes (whether comical or horrific) are true, which makes the whole thing so strange. Goring is showing off his model train set to Heydrich when he&#39;s there to get the final solution started...</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Anyway, the RSHA hydra has enough heads to keep him busy. So now he has to delegate. He gives each of the RSHA’s seven divisions to a colleague who is selected first and foremost for his abilities rather than his politics—and this is rare enough to be worth mentioning in the lunatic asylum that is the Nazi regime. Heinrich Müller, for example, who is put in charge of the Gestapo—and who identifies so completely with his job that hereafter he is known simply as “Gestapo” Müller—is a former Christian Democrat: an affiliation that does not prevent him from becoming one of the Nazis’ most devastating weapons. The other RSHA offices are given to brilliant intellectuals: youngsters such as Ohlendorf (Inland-SD) and Schellenberg (Ausland-SD), or experienced academics like Six (Written Records). Such men contrast strongly with the cohort of cranks, illiterates, and mental degenerates who populate the Party’s higher echelons. One minor branch of the Gestapo—a status that does not reflect its true importance, but it’s always better to remain discreet with such sensitive subjects—is devoted to Jewish affairs. Heydrich already knows who he wants to run it: that little Austrian Hauptsturmführer who did such good work before, Adolf Eichmann.</p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/bb22_bouvard.jpg" class="floatright nofancybox"><p>Gustave Flaubert, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bouvard-Pecuchet-P%C3%A9cuchet-Gustave-Flaubert/dp/1564783936?crid=2TPXIKA0DJZIY&keywords=Bouvard+and+Pecuchet&qid=1672244859&sprefix=the+selected+poetry+of+rainer+maria+rilke%2Caps%2C775&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=641a35b2ab65b19d5b842eca16d24a85&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bouvard and Pecuchet</a></strong></p><p>It&#39;s difficult to write anything about this bizarre, unfinished novel. Despite being comic or satirical, it&#39;s never really funny. It&#39;s extraordinarily repetitive. There are really no characters, no plot, no development of any sort. And yet it&#39;s a powerful commentary on the tragedy of the human quest for knowledge. With it, Flaubert renounced all his earlier technique and essentially inaugurated the 20th century (post-)modernist tradition in literature. I can&#39;t really recommend it, but it&#39;s a unique masterpiece.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>They no longer had a single fixed idea about the individuals and events of that time. To form an impartial judgment, they would have to read every history, every memoir, every newspaper and manuscript, for the slightest omission could foster an error that would lead to others, and on unto infinity. They gave up. But they had acquired a taste for history, a need for truth for its own sake. Perhaps the truth was more easily uncovered in earlier periods? Surely the authors recounted events more dispassionately at a greater remove. And they delved into the good Rollin. “What a load of hogwash!” cried Bouvard as of the first chapter.</p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/bb22_america.jpg" class="floatleft nofancybox"><p>Alexis de Tocqueville, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Democracy-America-text-only-Tocqueville/dp/B0043QWB68?keywords=Democracy+in+America+everyman&qid=1656875469&sr=8-2&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=16e495a05fc03a6fa57dffe0e50f0adb&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democracy in America</a></strong></p><p>Here&#39;s a book that manages to entirely live up to its reputation.

Not one of these great writers would now be accepted to any MFA in the country.

Dark and beautiful. This may well be the last great novel of the human era in literature. It would be fitting for the 89-year old McCarthy to be writing a coda for himself and humanity at the same time. Especially since he views the 20th century productions of science and engineering as far more important and groundbreaking than those in literature.</p><p>The plot is mostly irrelevant. Both books consist mostly of conversations: bars and restaurants for the first, a psychiatric institution for the second. McCarthy grapples with every idea that&#39;s been on his mind for the last few decades: mathematics, physics, language, the unconscious, the sins of the father, Kant, evolution, psychology, gnosticism, genius. It&#39;s not just a novel of ideas, though—<em>The Passenger</em> is filled with yearning, regret, nostalgia, isolation...just an incredibly melancholic atmosphere in general. Stella Maris is geekier, and basically The Virgin Internal Voice vs The Chad Cerebration: The Novel.</p><p>To the usual mix of Hemingway and Captain Ahab, McCarthy adds strains of Pynchon and DeLillo. It works.</p><p>There&#39;s even a cool, oblique Borges allusion: toward the end, Bobby writes down a couple of lines from a 17th century German poet, Daniel von Czepko. Those lines form the epigram of <a href="https://www.gwern.net/docs/borges/1947-borges-anewrefutationoftime.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A New Refutation of Time</a>!</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tiger-Technology-Semiconductor-Cambridge-Asia-Pacific/dp/0521035678?crid=2KT05BPSYRC7U&keywords=tiger+technology+semiconductor&qid=1672248255&sprefix=tiger+technology+semiconduct%2Caps%2C192&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=9604aa69e2a4bedf76df1456eabb101e&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tiger Technology: The Creation of a Semiconductor Industry in East Asia</a></strong>, by John a. Matthews. This book comes out of academic &quot;management&quot; studies, which entails a lot of bullshit. A lot of overdone abstract ideas that are never really tested, a lot of extremely silly diagrams, etc. And its predictions about the future (it came out in 2000) turned out quite wrong. Viewed purely as a collection of facts it&#39;s quite an interesting book, however.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Chip-War-Worlds-Critical-Technology/dp/1982172002?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1672248278&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=703ce08bf1aa4f69581a5275832e2ea7&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chip War: The Fight for the World&#39;s Most Critical Technology</a></strong>, by Chris Miller.

    <title>Forecasting Forecasting</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The forecasting ecosystem is in a weird spot right now. The &quot;traditional&quot; approach began with large-scale experiments focusing on the wisdom of the crowds, market mechanisms, etc. People were inspired by the predictive power of financial markets and wanted to replicate their strengths in other domains—policy, diplomacy, war, disease, science.</p><p>We quickly began to see a divergence, starting with the &quot;superforecaster&quot; phenomenon: researchers noticed that certain people consistently outperformed the rest, and if you focused on their views you could outperform both the experts and the crowd. Competitive prediction aggregation/market platforms also have serious issues with information sharing between participants, which is a big part of why teams of top forecasters outperform markets as a whole. It has taken a long time for this movement to play out, but I feel it has been accelerating lately and wanted to write down a few comments on where I think forecasting is headed.</p><p>One issue is identifying superforecasters. If you don&#39;t have access to them (they are GJO&#39;s moat in a way), then you need to find them on your own (or at least find a way to reach out to them and attract them). Thus other projects like CSET/INFER ran crowd forecasting platforms and then picked out the top predictors for their &quot;pro team&quot;, for example. Recent <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Dm5eNgyvEwF9ibvzj/participate-in-the-hybrid-forecasting-persuasion-tournament" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI forecasting efforts</a> have also tried to pick out a small number of top forecasters. And then you have groups like <a href="https://www.swiftcentre.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swift</a> and <a href="https://samotsvety.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Samotsvety</a> (as Scott Alexander says, &quot;If the point of forecasting tournaments is to figure out who you can trust, the science has spoken, and the answer is “these guys”.&quot;). Why pay tens of thousands for a prediction market (which takes time and effort to organize) when you can just give a couple of grand to Nuño and get better answers, faster?</p><p>Others have tried to do away with the market mechanism even without having access to top forecasting talent. The DARPA SCORE program (which I&#39;ve written about before) had two separate components for prediction, one market-based (Replication Markets) and another which used a structured group discussion format to arrive at estimates (RepliCATS). The results aren&#39;t out yet, but my understanding is that RepliCATS outperformed the markets.</p><p>Personally, I find the shift from open markets and various fancy scoring and incentive mechanisms to &quot;put a handful of smart dudes in a room and ask them questions&quot; a bit disappointing. Why did we even need the markets and forecasting platforms in the first place? To identify the smart dudes, of course—but is that all there is to it? As the top forecasters abandon markets and start competing against them, they are (in a way) pulling up the ladder behind them. We need the public tournaments to identify the talent in the first place, but if the money just goes straight into Samotsvety&#39;s pockets instead of open tournaments, new people can&#39;t join the ecosystem any more. Where is the next Samotsvety going to come from? Part of the problem is that there&#39;s a positive externality to identifying forecasting talent and it&#39;s difficult to capture that value, so we end up with a bit of a market failure.</p><p>Perhaps the only way to make markets competitive is to make them lucrative enough that it&#39;s worthwhile to form hedge fund-like teams which can generate <em>internal</em> benefits from information-sharing and deploy those onto the market, with the added benefit of honing them through competition. But that seems unlikely at the moment, the money just isn&#39;t there.</p><p>In one of the possible worlds ahead of us, the endpoint of this process will be the re-creation of the consulting firm—except for real this time. With the right kind of marketing angle I could easily see Samotsvety becoming a kind of 21st century McKinsey for the hip SV crowd that wants to signal that it needs <em>actual</em> advice rather than political cover. Could the forecasters avoid the pitfalls of the consultancy world?</p><p>What are the limits to forecasting accuracy? Eli Lifland <a href="https://www.foxy-scout.com/retro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is skeptical</a> about the possibility of improving his abilities, but I&#39;m not sure I buy that line entirely. We&#39;re still very early on, and many obvious low-hanging fruits have yet to be tried. If the forecasting-group-as-consultancy takes off, I would expect to see many serious attempts at improvement, starting with things like teaching domain experts forecasting and then putting them in close collaboration with top-tier generalists and forecasters.</p><p>What worries me is that this is a movement away from objective scoring and back towards reputation-based systems of trust. Once you leave the world of open markets and platforms, you become disconnected from their inescapable, public, and powerful error-correcting mechanisms—weak arguments can once again be laundered in the dirty soapwater of prominence and influence. Perhaps the current crop of top forecasters have the integrity to avoid going down that path, but how can that be maintained in the long run, with a powerful headwind of incentives and entryism blowing against us?</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="From-Above-Metaethics"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2022/10/10/against-effective-altruism/#From-Above-Metaethics" class="headerlink" title="From Above: Metaethics"></a>From Above: Metaethics</h1><p>You&#39;re (probably) all theological anti-realists; just apply the same reasoning to the existence of moral facts! If the magical invisible sky god is obviously fake, why do you accept magical invisible sky moral facts? Just take the standard &quot;rationalist&quot; toolkit, apply it to realism, and it disappears in a puff of smoke. The arguments can just be copy pasted: for example, one of the classic (and most powerful) arguments from the New Atheism internet wars was that theists are really atheists about every god except their own. The moral realist is an anti-realist about all moral claims except the ones he happens to like! What is the base rate of moral truth, and why do you believe your inside view is enough to overcome that?</p><p>Realist arguments always come across as utterly absurd because their task is 1) extremely simple and obvious, and 2) impossible. All they have to do is say &quot;we used methods x, y, z to uncover moral facts a, b, c, and you can replicate the procedure independently to verify our results&quot;. But it&#39;s never like that, it&#39;s always some interminable verbcel nonsense to cover up the fact that they don&#39;t actually have any access to the moral facts that their theory says they <em>should</em> have access to!</p><p>Whenever I hear the word &quot;intuition&quot; out of the mouth of a philosopher I reach for my Browning!<span class="tooltip"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2022/10/10/against-effective-altruism/#fn10280584171" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref10280584171">1</sup></a></span></p><p>It comes down to this:</p><ul><li>Naturalism: no evidence</li><li>Non-naturalism: magic</li></ul><p>Often they&#39;ll back off and come up with excuses about why moral facts aren&#39;t accessible in that way, but that just wrecks the whole thing. Even if realism <em>is</em> true, if there&#39;s no reliable empirical access to moral facts, then that&#39;s functionally equivalent to anti-realism. Any defense based on the immunity of moral propositions to empirical investigation also makes it impossible to find the truth. Your metaethics either has to have a way to determine what&#39;s true in ethics, or you&#39;re practically a nihilist.</p><p>Traditionally the problem has been solved with an appeal to God but EAs are, to a first approximation, 100% atheist. You can&#39;t pull an <em>Euthyphro</em> any more, so WHAT&#39;S YOUR MORAL EPISTEMOLOGY MOTHERFUCKER? Why do epistemic standards seem to suddenly disappear when it comes to utilitarianism? Why am I constantly being asked to believe in the existence of these ontologically redundant entities?</p><p>The <em>theologians</em> at least have the decency to offer <em>some</em> kind of story: ask them about the origin of God and they might invoke the cosmological argument or the principle of sufficient reason. Ask a <em>moralogian</em> about the origin of moral facts and all you&#39;ll get in return is a stupefied bovine expression. The <em>theologians</em> can <em>at least</em> appeal to miracles. The <em>moralogians</em> appeal to <em>nothing</em> and expect you to accept it! Is the origin of moral facts natural, or supernatural? If natural, can we engineer our own? Why or why not? The universe, fundamentally, is dumb. You are positing the existence of entities that are very much not dumb. Where the hell did they come from?</p><p>Above all the <em>moralogian</em> is conspicuously shameless. Even in the 13th century, a man like Aquinas (who would not meet a single doubter in his entire life) felt it necessary to justify his faith and present arguments in favor of the existence of God. Today&#39;s moralogian on the other hand feels no such compulsion, although he is beset on all sides by skeptics! The EA.org <a href="https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/metaethics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">page on meta-ethics</a> speaks for itself:</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/ea_metaethics.png"><p>Is this an excess of certainty, or is it because deep down the moralogian knows he has no real arguments?</p><p>And the moralogians are not stuck in airy castles of thought, they operate in the real world. The neoconservatives, for example, are a showcase of what happens when the moralogian takes hold of the reins of foreign policy—and it is a consistent ideology that genuinely seeks to spread the values it values. Buckhardt wrote that the foreign policy of Italian states of the Renaissance, free as it was from &quot;moral scruples&quot;, gave him &quot;the impression of a bottomless abyss&quot;. But who today could not prefer that naked self-interest to the neocon disaster of democracy and human rights? The effective altruists have yet to screw up that badly, but just look at the people who want to eliminate all wildlife and you have a good preview of what is possible—&quot;<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/10177384-man-your-head-is-haunted-you-have-wheels-in-your" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Man, your head is haunted!</a>&quot;</p><p>Peter Singer offers one of the most memorable instances of intellectual cowardice in the entire history of philosophy. Like any reasonable person, he used to be an anti-realist. Then he read Parfit and realized that anti-realism meant utilitarianism was not the case (not sure why it took Parfit to point that out to him). Instead of abandoning utilitarianism, he became a realist just to salvage his ideology! Pathetic.</p><p>Hilariously, Parfit later abandoned realism for what he calls &quot;non-realist cognitivism&quot;, which is basically the Sam Harris view except with bigger words.<span class="tooltip"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2022/10/10/against-effective-altruism/#fn10280584172" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref10280584172">2</sup></a></span> Part 7 of vol. 3 of <em>On What Matters</em> is an incredible trainwreck, worth skimming just to see what kind of pretzel shapes people will contort themselves into in order to avoid accepting the obvious. At least Parfit understands that adding a magical normative layer on top of reality is completely incompatible with the scientific <em>weltanschauung</em>.</p><p>&quot;But Alvaro, your instrumental goals are sort of like morality, maybe we could just re-brand...&quot; Just let it go, man.</p><h1 id="From-Straight-Ahead-What-39-s-Going-On-Here"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2022/10/10/against-effective-altruism/#From-Straight-Ahead-What-39-s-Going-On-Here" class="headerlink" title="From Straight Ahead: What&#39;s Going On Here?"></a>From Straight Ahead: What&#39;s Going On Here?</h1><p>You&#39;re not actually a utilitarian anyway. At best it&#39;s a kind of ideal. That&#39;s why you <em>tithe</em> 10%. Just go with the 90% of your intuition that says &quot;this shit is whack, yo&quot;. How do ideologies avoid purity spirals? <a href="https://handsandcities.com/2021/03/07/care-and-demandingness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heuristics against demandingness</a>. It’s one heuristic battling another! Why not go all the way with the one that’s winning?</p><p>So you&#39;re probably not a realist, and probably not a utilitarian either...where does this EA compulsion come from? You must have been memed into it. Don&#39;t feel bad, it happens to all of us, that&#39;s how these things work.</p><h1 id="From-Below-Genealogy"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2022/10/10/against-effective-altruism/#From-Below-Genealogy" class="headerlink" title="From Below: Genealogy"></a>From Below: Genealogy</h1><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Nature has never generated a terminal value except through hypertrophy of an instrumental value.

What does it mean for altruism to be &quot;effective&quot;? EAs take it for granted that the most effective altruism is the altruism that helps its <em>targets</em> the most. I would argue that altruism is really meant to help the altru<em>ist</em>, not the altru<em>ee</em>. That&#39;s the only way it could have evolved. So here&#39;s my pitch to you: effective altruism is the altruism that raises your status the most. The conspicuous lack of caring about the &quot;effectiveness&quot; of altruism among normal people is a hint! <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/11/arts/music/metropolitan-operas-donations-hit-a-record-182-million.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hundreds of millions per year for the NY Metropolitan Opera?</a> Sure, why not! They&#39;re not misfiring, <em>you are</em>.</p><p>Of course the problem with optimizing for status is that if you&#39;re <em>seen</em> as optimizing for status rather than having a plausible excuse<span class="tooltip"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2022/10/10/against-effective-altruism/#fn10280584174" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref10280584174">4</sup></a></span>, it&#39;s bad—the altruism that increases your status the most is also the one that you can credibly signal that you <em>actually believe in</em>. Thus we get Triversian self-deception where the altruist &quot;really means it&quot; (but of course if he really meant it he wouldn&#39;t be giving 10%). So <em>Actual</em> Effective Altruism is simply too gauche to exist. If you hang around the Bay Aryan rationalists then EA may well satisfy those goals (and I&#39;m sure there are many in EA purely for cynical reasons). But if you&#39;re not part of that crowd...</p><p>Scott Alexander <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/07/24/value-differences-as-differently-crystallized-metaphysical-heuristics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writes</a> that &quot;all of our values are unjustifiable crystallizations of heuristics at some level&quot;, and then continues specifically on utilitarianism:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>To be absolutely brutal about it:</p><p>EXPLICIT MODEL: Helping others will key me in to networks of reciprocal altruism and raise my status in the community<br>EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCE: Desire to help others, empathy, horror at the suffering of others<br>REIFIED ESSENCE: “Utility”<br>ENDORSED VALUE: Utilitarianism, the belief that maximizing utility is the highest good regardless of what other goods it produces&quot;</p></div></blockquote><p>It&#39;s spot on! How someone can write that and go on believing in utilitarianism is beyond me, and Scott offers no explanation.</p><p>Now, you might be thinking &quot;But Alvaro, you idiot, we&#39;re adaptation executors, not fitness maximizers! This is all perfectly alright, you see.&quot; Sure, we&#39;re adaptation executors, but that doesn&#39;t give you a blank check to execute whatever retarded adaptation was bred into your hairy great-....great-grandfather 500,000 years ago, and is now <a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2020/03/03/memetic-defoundation/">incompatible with the world you live in</a> (or worse, become enslaved to &quot;unjustified crystallizations&quot; and meticulously engineered hyperstimuli designed to abuse your adaptations). Effective altruism is the coca cola of morality, and <em>you</em> are morally <em>obese</em>!</p><p>The adaptation for helping out people in your community has hypertrophied in the toxic sludge of modern civilization into an absurd ideology about maximizing imaginary sky utilons by helping people you will never meet, or who do not yet (and may never) exist. Given the rapid shift in our environment it&#39;s unsurprising that there are maladaptations in our system; but we can recognize and avoid them. Your &quot;adaptation execution&quot; has been memetically hijacked—where once you would get good things in return for your &quot;altruism&quot; (a stronger community, status, reciprocal altruism, coalition-building, or even &quot;niceness, community, and civilization&quot;), a runaway meme has now convinced you that it&#39;s actually better to get <em>nothing</em>!<span class="tooltip"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2022/10/10/against-effective-altruism/#fn10280584175" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref10280584175">5</sup></a></span> You get all the costs of religion, and none of the prosocial benefits! Even worse, the infected are trying to spread this meme to others. Things are in the saddle, and ride <em>you</em>! It&#39;s a particularly dumb version of your typical California cult in which there isn&#39;t <em>even</em> a creepy guy with a harem of underage girls at the top. What&#39;s the point, man?</p><p>There was a type of deer in Ireland whose antlers hypertrophied (probably through sexual selection) to the point that it killed off the entire species. When I look at effective altruists, all I see is overgrown antlers pulling them to the ground.</p><p>The absurdity is heightened because we <em>obviously know where these tendencies come from</em>, regardless of what philosophers try to imagine. We know where the evolved desire to gobble up an entire cake comes from—as you resist the clarion call of the chocolate cake, so you must also resist the call of &quot;effective&quot; altruism. A serious valuing of values can only begin when this baggage is dispensed with and laughed at.</p><h1 id="Fin"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2022/10/10/against-effective-altruism/#Fin" class="headerlink" title="Fin"></a>Fin</h1><p>There are plenty of arguments against utilitarianism&#39;s internal logic: problems with interpersonal comparisons, aggregation, second-order effects, negative utility, average utility, discounting, etc. Whether you go negative, average, rule, or <em>fluorescent</em> there are tons of inescapable and fatal flaws. Empirically, human beings <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1043463118784888?journalCode=rssa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don&#39;t have coherent utility functions</a> so what are we even maximizing? Above all, utilitarians ignore the value (and necessity) of suffering—for life and for Life. The fine porcelain of your being was forged in the fires of hell.</p><p>But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary to meet utilitarianism on its own turf, so...<span class="tooltip"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2022/10/10/against-effective-altruism/#fn10280584176" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref10280584176">6</sup></a></span></p><p>Let me also say that atheism for the masses, in retrospect, was an enormous error. Organized religion as a social technology is invaluable and the modern atomized welfare state is a pathetic replacement. Atheism for the intellectual class is perfectly alright, but in the age of mass literacy there is really no barrier between them and the rest of society. Was atheism inevitable? Perhaps. But the New Atheists certainly didn&#39;t help. Extrapolating this line of reasoning is left as an exercise to the reader.</p><p>Are there values which are not merely instrumental? In a way—Gnon and all that. Do they have anything to do with the values of effective altrusim? Of course not.

Tangled, fragmented, unclear, conflicting, and circular narratives/motivations/goals/priorities. A chopped-up story from various points of view, taking a look at a world filled with great characters surrounding the titular Nostromo. Politics, heroism, revolt, the worth of social status, reputations, perceptions, allegiances, and material vs idealistic interests. Betrayals of all kinds. Private and public vindications and redemptions. Great stuff.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Glass-Bead-Game-Magister-Novel/dp/0312278497?crid=1N2UZENODSN6F&keywords=The+Glass+Bead+Game&qid=1665069003&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIyLjE5IiwicXNhIjoiMS4zMSIsInFzcCI6IjEuNDIifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=nostromo+conrad%2Caps%2C248&sr=8-1&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.006c50ae-5d4c-4777-9bc0-4513d670b6bc&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=a1f306648d541bd5d8a0f70cd5de2678&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Glass Bead Game</a></strong> by Hermann Hesse. Fascinating Borgesian novel about a futuristic game that combines all arts and sciences into some sort of grand unified plaything. It&#39;s about music, duty, the lifecycle of organizations, transcendence, the life of the mind, and probably much more on top of that. Highly recommended.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Imperial-Twilight-Opium-Chinas-Golden/dp/0345803027?crid=2807CT4RHY6BJ&keywords=imperial+twilight&qid=1665069030&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIxLjk4IiwicXNhIjoiMS44OSIsInFzcCI6IjIuMDEifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=imperial+twilig%2Caps%2C260&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=d9947487a2ceee1e07e32444d614d140&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Imperial Twilight: The Opium War and the End of China&#39;s Last Golden Age</a></strong> by Stephen R. Platt. Kind of weirdly structured, it mainly takes a look at the era from the point of view of various minor players, mostly traders, &quot;supercargos&quot;, and so on. The big politics don&#39;t get much attention. Somewhat revisionist I guess? It&#39;s fine.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Break-Out-Crystal-Palace-Anarcho-Psychological-Dostoevsky/dp/1138882046?crid=1V7T3OH9Z6MTZ&keywords=Break-Out+from+the+Crystal+Palace&qid=1664802796&sprefix=break-out+from+the+crystal+palace+%2Caps%2C232&sr=8-1&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.006c50ae-5d4c-4777-9bc0-4513d670b6bc&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=948e1d4f0796fc7b70ce0d43c9e31959&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Break-Out from the Crystal Palace: The Anarcho-Psychological Critique; Stirner, Nietzsche, Dostoevsky</a></strong> by John Carroll.

Another Herzog book! Nowhere near as brilliant as Conquest of the Useless, unfortunately, but still not bad. Concerns of those Japanese soldiers who kept up the guerilla war for decades after the end of WW2, refusing to surrender and refusing to face reality. Very Herzogian with the jungle and everything. Some wonderful metaphors.</p></li></ul><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Otherland-Golden-Shadow-Tad-Williams/dp/0756416922?crid=QZIW7UH5A2JS&keywords=City+of+Golden+Shadow&qid=1665069090&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIxLjkxIiwicXNhIjoiMS44MiIsInFzcCI6IjEuODAifQ%3D%3D&s=books&sprefix=city+of+golden+shadow%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C480&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=2d80b38da06b2e528fd6ea68e1ad3419&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">City of Golden Shadow</a></strong> by Tad Williams. Gwern gave it 5 stars so I couldn&#39;t resist, but I didn&#39;t enjoy it at all. Absurdly overlong at 800 pages, it just ends with a cliffhanger (and there&#39;s more than one sequel). There&#39;s a series of parallel fantastical stories set in a virtual reality and they&#39;re all pointless and awful. A bit outdated in terms of how it imagines the internet, it does have a few interesting ideas but overall I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth the effort.</li></ul><ul><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296?crid=188FBFXHT5WSD&keywords=Zero+to+One&qid=1665069123&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIyLjAzIiwicXNhIjoiMS44NCIsInFzcCI6IjIuMDUifQ%3D%3D&s=books&sprefix=city+of+golden+shadow%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C562&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=9057fa99bccacc46f86cdc519d4cf810&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zero to One</a></strong> by Peter Thiel.

Split into 257 short chapters, it blends a straightfoward and minimally fictionalized retelling of Operation Anthropoid (the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich) with all sorts of metafictional elements, as Binet constantly comments on the issues with constructing a historical novel, compares his approach to other books and movies, and even brings his personal life into it. Irony, humor, self-consciousness (especially about the author&#39;s view of Heydrich), the tension between history and fiction, and a slow, horrific build-up that absolutely fills you with terror. Strange how powerful emotionally a book that is at the same time so detached can be. Quite good and very different.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Man-Who-Loved-Only-Numbers/dp/0786884061?crid=30PLW4QLCRWDA&keywords=The+Man+Who+Loved+Only+Numbers&qid=1665069512&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIwLjI4IiwicXNhIjoiMC4yNCIsInFzcCI6IjAuMzIifQ%3D%3D&s=books&sprefix=the+man+who+loved+only+numbers%2Cstripbooks%2C340&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=4e197068f0851d6b2ab8b1dcefcdcdd5&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Man Who Loved Only Numbers: The Story of Paul Erdős and the Search for Mathematical Truth</a></strong> by Paul Hoffman.

Carroll. A curious artifact from a different era. Perfectly captures the zeitgeist of the peak of internet atheism and creationism debates. One could make statements about human evolution then which would be quite dangerous today. The stuff on DNA and evolution is pretty wide and not that deep. All of it has been covered better elsewhere. There&#39;s a chapter on EvoDevo for example, but it stays on the surface of things and I would recommend reading <em>Endless Forms Most Beautiful</em> (by the same author!) instead. On top of the evolution stuff you also have a random sprinkling of skeptic-related causes (dull and cringey rants about chiropractors), plus a very generic liberal environmentalism which basically ignores everything the author had written up to that point. Probably more interesting as a marker of a (short, but memorable) era than a book about DNA and evolution.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Moon-Sixpence-W-Somerset-Maugham/dp/1420951920?crid=16UV8LV22D3JX&keywords=the+moon+and+sixpence+maugham&qid=1665069460&refresh=1&s=books&sprefix=the+moon+and+sixpence+maugh%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C189&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=90e8462720590f04aee4066966d9ef4d&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Moon and Sixpence</a></strong> by Somerset W. Maugham. A fictionalized retelling of the life of Paul Gaugin, as a middle-aged English man abandons his family to go be a painter in Paris (and eventually Tahiti). I wasn&#39;t convinced by the central character, and there&#39;s nothing to this novel beyond him. The &quot;egotistic, single-minded genius&quot; trope has been done much better elsewhere, and the novel really strays very far from the actual life of Gaugin.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Golden-Bowl-Penguin-Classics/dp/0141441275?crid=3HSYOVV9PVF58&keywords=The+Golden+Bowl&qid=1665069486&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIzLjQ5IiwicXNhIjoiMy4xMSIsInFzcCI6IjMuMTAifQ%3D%3D&s=books&sprefix=the+golden+bowl%2Cstripbooks%2C519&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=159de31c121822be325f8304677b23e9&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Golden Bowl</a></strong> by Henry James.

An unstructured mishmash of warmed-over pop science and a cavalcade of bad arguments around abduction, philosophy of science, intelligence, infinity, qualia, etc. The arguments<br>about superhuman general intelligence not being possible because humans are universal Turing machines are utterly absurd and could be added verbatim to &quot;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10987" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On the Impossibility of Supersized Machines</a>&quot;. One of the worst treatments of abduction in the history of philosophy, and that&#39;s really saying something. Deutsch&#39;s comments on heritability are downright idiotic, and it&#39;s clear that he didn&#39;t even bother spending 30 seconds reading the wikipedia page. He just makes stuff up (incorrectly). A lot of uppity commentary about shit he doesn&#39;t understand. And then it&#39;s just filled with a whole bunch of random shit, like a galaxybrained theory of why the UK has the best voting system, a terrible theory of aesthetics, etc.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Man-Who-Loved-Only-Numbers/dp/0786884061?crid=30PLW4QLCRWDA&keywords=The+Man+Who+Loved+Only+Numbers&qid=1665069512&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIwLjI4IiwicXNhIjoiMC4yNCIsInFzcCI6IjAuMzIifQ%3D%3D&s=books&sprefix=the+man+who+loved+only+numbers%2Cstripbooks%2C340&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=4e197068f0851d6b2ab8b1dcefcdcdd5&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">First Light</a></strong> by Geoffrey Wellum.

This particular one, among the pastoral tribes of the marshes of southern Iraq. Perhaps what makes it unique is that it is set not in the 19th century, but in the late 1950s. Comfy but unexceptional, ultimately the Madan are just not that interesting.</p><p></p></li></ul>]]></content>

Lives up to its reputation. Fascinating observations on law, politics, psychology, sociology, America&#39;s Westward expansion, and more. Prefigures Timur Kuran in many ways. Incredibly prescient. Interesting both in terms of what has stayed the same since it was written, but also for a look at all that has changed. &quot;The French lawyer is simply a man extensively acquainted with the statutes of his country; but the English or American lawyer resembles the hierophants of Egypt, for like them he is the sole interpreter of an occult science.&quot;</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://sylviaioannoufoundation.org/en/collection/digital-library/b0077/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Memoirs of the Baron de Tott, on the Turks and the Tartars</a></strong>, by the Baron de Tott. Found through <a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2020/01/31/reading-notes-civilization-capitalism/">Braudel</a>. Written just a few decades before <em>Democracy in America</em>, the Baron de Tott went East instead of West. And instead of seeing the future, he saw the past. Roughly at the time the American revolution was happening, the same time when Johnson and Boswell were drinking too much claret at the Mitre, de Tott was joining the Crimean Tatars on a slave raid into Southern Russia. Most fascinating for its observations of Ottoman society, and the role de Tott played in the Russo-Turkish war of &#39;68-&#39;74. Somewhat niche and obviously nowhere near as insightful as <em>Democracy in America</em>, but definitely worth a read if this is your kind of thing. What causes the fall of empires? Culture, Tott says: all decay ultimately comes from within.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Collapse-Complex-Societies-Studies-Archaeology/dp/052138673X?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1656875629&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=e4415259732dc12daf416a9d755cdc6b&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Collapse of Complex Societies</a></strong>, by Joseph Tainter. Tainter&#39;s theory mostly comes down to decreasing marginal returns to additional societal complexity, which eventually leads to collapse. Parts of it are highly reminiscent of Chaisson&#39;s Energy-Rate Density paper (which everyone should read), but much more limited in scope. He&#39;s too focused on explaining everything with a single theory, leaving little room for contingency in history. He ignores the aspect of time: just because a system works well for 10 years does not mean it can work for 1000. And he treats rulers as being virtually unconstrained in their policy choices.</p><p>The examples he marshals in support of this theory are not particularly convincing, and (at least in some cases like the Western Roman Empire), the Mancur Olson view which focuses on public choice issues (which Tainter pretty much dismisses out of hand) seems like a vastly better fit to me. Especially when it comes to contemporary society, the examples Tainter brings up seem like a slam dunk in favor of Olson and <em>against</em> Tainter! Take education for example: is it really plausible that the ballooning costs and declining efficiency of educational spending over the past few decades is due to increased complexity? Of course not, it&#39;s clearly an issue of special interest groups with socially misaligned incentives. Tainter misses it because he never actually dives into the details of exactly <em>how</em> increased complexity is supposed to be working to produce all these effects.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Machiavellians-Defenders-Freedom-James-Burnham/dp/1839013958?crid=7IHHZKKW9G45&keywords=The+Machiavellians%3A+Defenders+of+Freedom&qid=1656875701&sprefix=%2Caps%2C1830&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=1b409a8a9e670a9c6848a98ee69275d4&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Machiavellians: Defenders of Freedom</a></strong>, by James Burnham. On Machiavelli and some of his successors: Mosca, Sorel, Michels, Pareto. Published in 1943 and it shows. Strong on the general ideas about the objective treatment of power and politics, divorced from sentimentality and moralizing. Pretty weak on the specifics.

Borges mentions that it inspired him to read German philosophy and that&#39;s how it ended up on my list. What can I even say about this crazy book? Carlyle invents a fictional German philosopher, who has written a treatise on clothing, and then also invents a fictional English editor who tries to explain the German philosopher&#39;s work, which turns out to be a philosophy of <em>everything</em>. Layer upon layer of irony and postmodern misdirection, and that outrageous Carlylean 19th century style to top it off. Heavily influenced by Tristram Shandy. Surprisingly influential (especially in America), though I&#39;m really not sure how seriously one is meant to take the ideas presented within.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Liftoff-Desperate-Early-Launched-SpaceX/dp/0062979981?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1656875669&sr=8-2&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=9d62ea58cf935deb698c9b7a593c2eec&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Liftoff: Elon Musk and the Desperate Early Days That Launched SpaceX</a></strong>, by Eric Berger. Fast-paced and exciting, mostly based on insider interviews, <em>Liftoff</em> gives a good idea of what the crazy early years were like at SpaceX. Once they start launching the Falcon 9 it skips over a decade in a few paragraphs, which kind of sucks. If you were wondering exactly what factors made SpaceX succeed where everyone else has failed, you will probably come away from the book disappointed. Still, recommended.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apollo-Race-Moon-Charles-Murray/dp/0671611011?crid=1LJ2PVBNPAG83&keywords=Apollo%3A+The+Race+to+the+Moon&qid=1656875826&sprefix=apollo+the+race+to+the+moon%2Caps%2C229&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=c8237fd431cab063cd44dcf0f99dcf43&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apollo: The Race to the Moon</a></strong>, by Charles Murray (yes, that Charles Murray). One of the better Apollo books, this one is focused mostly on the bureaucratic aspects with a few glimpses into engineering as well. At 500 pages it still feels far too short, as some major events and personalities are given very little space. Overall very strong, and it&#39;s truly astonishing how there was almost nothing at all in terms of the space program in 1960, how young everyone was, how nobody really knew what they were doing, etc. For some reason it seems to be out of print.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Book-That-Changed-Europe-Ceremonies/dp/0674049284?crid=1VJ1HKXWJJ7OA&keywords=The+Book+That+Changed+Europe%3A+Picart+%26+Bernard%27s+Religious+Ceremonies+of+the+World&qid=1656875880&sprefix=the+book+that+changed+europe+picart+%26+bernard%27s+religious+ceremonies+of+the+world%2Caps%2C527&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=c9329ec14c7643849b0c6c715feaa6a1&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Book That Changed Europe: Picart &amp; Bernard&#39;s Religious Ceremonies of the World</a></strong>, by Lynn Hunt.

Unorganized, repetitive, badly written, and filled with pointless digressions. There&#39;s an irrelevant digression in the very first paragraph of the book! Maybe if a competent editor had gone to town on it...Also, I think the authors wildly overrate the book&#39;s ultimate importance.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Distant-Mirror-Calamitous-14th-Century/dp/0345349571?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1656875976&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=c2eb45df85d2b177c401f53a133d7af4&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Distant Mirror: The Calamitous 14th Century</a></strong>, by Barbara Tuchman. Audiobook. A look at 14th century Europe, mostly as it was seen from the perspective of the French nobleman Enguerrand VII de Coucy. Mainly based on the Chronicles of Froissart. Plague, the 100 years&#39; war, religious fanaticism, popes and antipopes, peasant revolts, crusades, etc. Very entertaining, but it sacrifices quite a lot of rigor to get there. Too many blatantly false statements from the 14th century are taken at face value. And there&#39;s more than a bit of Monty Python about this: at points, I thought I discerned the distant—but unmistakable—beat of coconuts in the background of the audiobook. This sentence gives you the vibe: &quot;A decision was perforce taken to march straight through the dark, fobidding forest of the Ardennes, where, Froissart remarks with awed inaccuracy, &quot;no traveler had ever before passed.&quot;&quot;</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Project-Hail-Mary/dp/B08GB58KD5?crid=2ABDDWPC70P7R&keywords=Project+Hail+Mary&qid=1656876022&sprefix=project+hail+mary%2Caps%2C275&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=948c157e23e8b2e1c43436e5358596b9&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project Hail Mary</a></strong>, by Andy Weir.

Newstok. A Romantic old-man-yells-at-clouds tirade about modern education practices. It didn&#39;t change any of my views, but it didn&#39;t really attempt to do so in the first place: Newstok is a reformist, while I am strictly an abolitionist—and therefore far outside the target audience. I find it hard to separate mass education from the commoditization of knowledge, while Newstok believes we can have our cake and eat it too. In any case, if you want a passionate argument in favor of high-quality education interspersed with Shakespeare quotes, this is the book for you.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Frank-Herberts-Dune-3-Book-Boxed/dp/0593201892?crid=3U4MMQO42NODF&keywords=dune+herbert&qid=1649063077&sprefix=dune+he%2Caps%2C317&sr=8-3&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=0d077bc42ee5ecc5eb58e4cf6902769e&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dune</a></strong>, by Frank Herbert. Pretty great, Herbert constructs a deeply alluring world which pulls you in despite some rather hilariously implausible aspects. It&#39;s interesting how so much of the &quot;plot&quot; actually happens in the background. The audiobook is quite good.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Frank-Herberts-Dune-3-Book-Boxed/dp/0593201892?crid=3U4MMQO42NODF&keywords=dune+herbert&qid=1649063077&sprefix=dune+he%2Caps%2C317&sr=8-3&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=0d077bc42ee5ecc5eb58e4cf6902769e&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dune Messiah</a></strong>, by Frank Herbert. I was told the sequels get crazy, and this is a pretty good start in that direction! Can&#39;t wait to see where this nonsense ends up. This is basically a book of palace intrigue and scheming, with a rich religious/predestination/weird time loop sauce on top.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Star-Maker-Olaf-Stapledon/dp/0486466833?crid=1YV5UG2XWKK7U&keywords=star+maker&qid=1649063124&sprefix=star%2Caps%2C941&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=1ee0aedc2c6127e7caf250f857164658&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Star Maker</a></strong>, by Olaf Stapledon. I kept thinking that it felt like a really weird throwback to the 1920s-30s, then I looked it up and it was written in 1937. Whoops. It&#39;s a non-stop torrent of interesting science fiction ideas, but there&#39;s no continuity, no characters to latch on to, and the examination of the ideas stays at the surface level. It&#39;s just a series of &quot;this happened, then this happened, then this happened&quot; which I found rather boring.</li><li><strong><a href>The Island of Doctor Death and Other Stories and Other Stories</a></strong>, by Gene Wolfe. Some fantastic stories in this collection, in particular I loved Feather Tigers, Death of Dr. Island, Toy Theater, and Seven American Nights. Many of them are in that classic Wolfe style where you have to piece together what&#39;s going on from tiny hints left in the text, and it&#39;s all a bit ambiguous in the end and so on. There&#39;s a lot of focus on religion and death (with two stories, <em>The Hero as Werwolf</em> and <em>The Doctor of Death Island</em>, being fairly explicitly death-ist).</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Orphans-Sky-Robert-Heinlein/dp/0671318454?crid=188W5DP34R9LB&keywords=orphans+of+the+sky&qid=1649063511&sprefix=orphans+of+the+s%2Caps%2C234&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=a8feb1e2dba52cbe188fbee2263df408&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Orphans of the Sky</a></strong>, by Robert Heinlein. Fairly standard generation ship story. Juvenile and ham-fisted (there&#39;s a scene where the protagonist literally yells out &quot;and yet it moves!&quot;). Mutants and knife fights and all that. 12 year old me would&#39;ve loved it.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wittgensteins-Nephew-Novel-Vintage-International/dp/1400077567?keywords=Wittgenstein%27s+Nephew&qid=1649063536&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=525837e06e74e8fca7b0c3fac02b6702&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wittgenstein&#39;s Nephew</a></strong>, by Thomas Bernhard. Bernhard documents his friendship with Paul Wittgenstein (not the pianist), a black sheep of the Wittgenstein family who suffered from various mental problems. They&#39;re both rejected by Austrian society, and they both reject it. Bernhard&#39;s attitude toward awards (he views them as a kind of insult and punishment) really sums up his relation to his country. A bitter book, sad and pathetic and miserly. Recommended if you&#39;re in the market for a feel-bad memoir.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Status-Game-Human-Life-Play/dp/0008354677?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1649063638&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=1e79a2cc8525d392bb7e1bee453a5e01&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Status Game: On Social Position and How We Use It</a></strong>, by Will Storr. There&#39;s quite a bit of overlap with <em>The Elephant in the Brain</em>, but Storr&#39;s book is obviously more focused on status. Also reminiscent of Goffman&#39;s <em>Presentation of Self in Everyday Life</em>. Lots of references to Boehm, Henrich, Kuran, Wrangham, etc. (You&#39;re probably better off going straight to the source?) If I had to choose between this and <em>Elephant</em> I&#39;d go for <em>Elephant</em>, but they&#39;re fairly complementary so it won&#39;t be a waste of your time to read both. Parts of the book are focused on contemporary culture war issues, which felt a bit shallow and tiresome. Overall it&#39;s not bad though.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Biology-Systems-Evolutionary-Foundations-Behavior-ebook/dp/B075GYH7JR?crid=1CR2WVWXBQ8DU&keywords=The+Biology+of+Moral+System&qid=1649063705&sprefix=the+biology+of+moral+system%2Caps%2C364&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=7210b68ae2e2ba13658a11526f0c3e10&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Biology of Moral Systems</a></strong>, by Richard Alexander. There&#39;s a great core here, but I wouldn&#39;t recommend it. The basic idea of approaching moral systems from an evopsych perspective is useful. However, huge swathes of text are wasted on dull and low-quality academic bickering, many of the specifics (eg the arguments on the development of religion) are completely off, and the last third of the book is dedicated to a mostly fruitless discussion of nuclear war and mutually assured destruction.</li></ul>]]></content>

Battutah was born in Morocco; he was not wealthy, but he was well-educated and went into the family business of Islamic law. At age 21, he set out for the pilgrimage to Mecca. He would extend his journey for decades, however, following traders in ships and caravans, relying on generous Muslim institutions and his talent for befriending rulers. He eventually covered virtually the entire Islamic world and beyond, from North Africa to China.</p><p>Battutah gets into all sorts of adventures (luckily escaping death by disease, shipwreck, pirates, bandits, and so on) and provides us with some incredible ethnographic observations. In Constantinople, he meets the Emperor. In India, he becomes a prominent and wealthy administrator under the rule of an erratic Sultan. In the Maldives, he marries six local women and lives a life of leisure under the shade of the palm trees. Yet his wanderlust compels him to keep moving. Battutah himself as a person, however, remains tantalizingly obscure.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Having divorced my wives I set sail. We came to a little island in the archipelago in which there was but one house, occupied by a weaver. He had a wife and family, a few coco-palms and a small boat, with which he used to fish and to cross over to any of the islands he wished to visit. His island contained also banana bushes, but we saw no land birds on it except two crows, which came out to us on our arrival and circled above our vessel. And I swear I envied that man, and wished that the island had been mine, that I might have made it my retreat until the inevitable hour should befall me.</p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/bb21_libra.jpg" class="floatright nofancybox"><p>Don DeLillo, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Libra-Contemporary-American-Fiction-DeLillo/dp/0140156046?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1642242862&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=ab64c1da21e6e03ca9ee8abd68d744f3&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Libra</strong></a></p><p>A semi-fictionalized biography of Lee Harvey Oswald in the Oliver Stone tradition, suffused with that great DeLillo style. There&#39;s also a kind of meta parallel story of an FBI agent trying to piece together all the evidence, meticulously going through even the tiniest element (much like DeLillo himself). It&#39;s quite Pynchonesque with all the criss-crossing conspiracies, the CIA, paranoia, axes of control and influence, a series of coincidences, taking liberty with history...and the ultimately mysterious &quot;fate&quot; that brought Oswald to the assassination. It lacks Pynchon&#39;s humor though.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>&quot;I don&#39;t know what they want me to do.&quot; &quot;Of course you know.&quot; &quot;Tell me where it happens.&quot; &quot;Miami.&quot; &quot;That means nothing to me.&quot; &quot;You&#39;ve known for weeks.&quot; &quot;What happens in Miami?&quot; Ferrie took a while to finish chewing his food. &quot;Think of two parallel lines,&quot; he said. &quot;One is the life of Lee H. Oswald. One is the conspiracy to kill the President. What bridges the space between them? What makes a connection inevitable? There is a third line. It comes out of dreams, visions, intuitions, prayers, out of the deepest levels of the self. It&#39;s not generated by cause and effect like the other two lines. It&#39;s a line that cuts across causality, cuts across time. It has no history that we can recognize or understand. But it forces a connection. It puts a man on the path of his destiny.&quot;</p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/bb21_manuscripts.jpg" class="floatleft nofancybox"><p>Christopher de Hamel, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Meetings-Remarkable-Manuscripts-Journeys-Medieval/dp/1594206112?keywords=meetings+with+remarkable+manuscripts&qid=1642245167&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=a8c4aa7e16c34acad2b8630aaae25f43&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Meetings with Remarkable Manuscripts: Twelve Journeys into the Medieval World</strong></a></p><p>Twelve chapters, each one dedicated to a different medieval manuscript, from the 6th century Gospels of St. Augustine to the 16th century Spinola Book of Hours. The book is filled with fantastic, gorgeous, high-quality prints from these manuscripts, interspersed with history and commentary in a pleasant conversational style. It&#39;s not just about the manuscripts themselves, but also who owned them, their condition, how they&#39;ve been maintained or altered, where they&#39;re housed, and the people taking care of them. Cultural differences in library regulatory practices are a virtually infinite source of comedy. Just lovely all around. Make sure you get the hardcover as the paperback is apparently printed in black &amp; white.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Confirmation that he was indeed both scribe and artist is found in the shape of the spaces left for the insertion of initials. Both scribes 2 and 3 (let us exclude 1 for the moment) left simple rectangular blank spaces where large initials were to be painted later, without thought to their shape or composition, and they added guidewords in the margins to indicate what letters were to be supplied. When Hugo came to fill them in, his flamboyantly fluid and multi-tentacled initials fitted uncomfortably into these big draughty square apertures. However, during the stint written by the last scribe from folio 185v onwards, the edges of the script are moulded line by line to fit around the curves and limbs of the painted initials, nestling together snugly like a newly married couple in bed. Text and decoration must have been executed simultaneously by the same person. In short, scribe 4 must be Hugo.</p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/bb21_vonneumann.jpg" class="floatright nofancybox"><p>Ananyo Bhattacharya, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-Man-from-the-Future/dp/0241398851?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1642245503&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=3d0b5206a2f6312ddde77541a9f4a088&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Man From the Future: The Visionary Life of John von Neumann</a></strong></p><p>Short, dense, and with a great balance between accessibility and dumbing down complex subjects. Bhattacharya approaches his subject by focusing on ideas. The first chapter takes care of JvN&#39;s early life, and the rest of the book is split up based on the subjects he worked on: mathematics, quantum mechanics, the nuclear bomb, computing, game theory, RAND, and artificial life. Large parts of the book (I&#39;d say about a third) are dedicated not to von Neumann but rather the work other people did based on his ideas. The game theory chapter, for example, covers Nash, Schelling, Aumann, etc. in economics, and John Maynard Smith, Price, Hamilton, etc. in evolutionary game theory. Bhattacharya is good at making all these technical subjects accessible without dumbing them down too much. The one failing point is that JvN&#39;s personality, personal life, and professional relationships don&#39;t get much attention.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>From 1944, meetings instigated by Norbert Wiener helped to focus von Neumann’s thinking about brains and computers. In gatherings of the short-lived ‘Teleological Society’, and later in the ‘Conferences on Cybernetics’, von Neumann was at the heart of discussions on how the brain or computing machines generate ‘purposive behaviour’. Busy with so many other things, he would whizz in, lecture for an hour or two on the links between information and entropy or circuits for logical reasoning, then whizz off again – leaving the bewildered attendees to discuss the implications of whatever he had said for the rest of the afternoon. Listening to von Neumann talk about the logic of neuro-anatomy, one scientist declared, was like ‘hanging on to the tail of a kite’. Wiener, for his part, had the discomfiting habit of falling asleep during discussions and snoring loudly, only to wake with some pertinent comment demonstrating he had somehow been listening after all.</p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/bb21_vasari.jpg" class="floatleft nofancybox"><p>Giorgio Vasari, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Painters-Sculptors-Architects-Everymans-Library/dp/0679451013?crid=34EOH3UWSF89R&keywords=vasari+everyman&qid=1642354706&sprefix=vasari+everym%2Caps%2C186&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=36e39c73f8af38252faffcd29927e3d6&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>The Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects</strong></a></p><p>History by way of biography—Vasari tells a tale of rebirth and artistic progress as Europe emerges from the dark ages, rediscovers the ancients, and then strives to surpass them. Tons of interesting observations on competition, collaboration, the spread of technology, and the psychology of (artistic) greatness. More than 180 lives in over 2000 pages, starting with Cimabue in the 13thC and reaching a climax with Michelangelo in the 16th. Somewhat gossipy and often inaccurate, it nonetheless remains our best source of information on the art and artists of Renaissance Italy. Vasari was a fairly successful painter himself, and his personal aquaintance with both the technique and the business of painting gives us an inside view of the craft. <a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/09/17/book-review-the-lives-of-the-most-excellent-painters-sculptors-and-architects/">Full review</a>.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>It is clear that Leonardo, through his comprehension of art, began many things and never finished one of them, since it seemed to him that the hand was not able to attain to the perfection of art in carrying out the things which he imagined; for the reason that he conceived in idea difficulties so subtle and so marvellous, that they could never be expressed by the hands, be they ever so excellent. And so many were his caprices, that, philosophizing of natural things, he set himself to seek out the properties of herbs, going on even to observe the motions of the heavens, the path of the moon, and the courses of the sun.</p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/bb21_schopenhauer.jpg" class="floatright nofancybox"><p>Arthur Schopenhauer, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Essays-Aphorisms-Penguin-Classics-Schopenhauer/dp/0140442278?crid=2ZB9Z9X10IUAJ&keywords=essays+and+aphorisms&qid=1642355269&sprefix=essays+and+aphori%2Caps%2C255&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=4c0505288b85624ec5cfbbfb07dc4ee5&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Essays and Aphorisms</strong></a></p><p>Excerpts from <em>Parerga und Paralipomena</em>. Unexpectedly hilarious; Arthur would&#39;ve been one hell of a poaster. Surprisingly similar to the pragmatists in many respects. Spans a huge number of topics: ethics, the will, intelligence, animal welfare, religion, suicide, writing, and much more.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Thus we see, for example, the Catholic clergy totally convinced of the truth of all the doctrines of <em>its</em> Church, and the Protestant clergy likewise convinced of the truth of all the doctrines of its Church, and both defending the doctrines of their confession with equal zeal. Yet this conviction depends entirely on the country in which each was born: to the South German priest the truth of the Catholic dogma is perfectly apparent, but to the North German priest it is that of Protestant dogma which is perfectly apparent. If, then, these convictions, and others like them, rest on objective grounds, these grounds must be climatic; such convictions must be like flowers, the one flourishing only here, the other only there.</p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/bb21_thucydides.jpg" class="floatleft nofancybox"><p>Thucydides, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Landmark-Thucydides-dp-1416590870/dp/1416590870?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=1642355297&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=e326827ce41dd8b3d9d9c6bfb31f0f2f&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>The History of the Peloponnesian War</strong></a></p><p>I&#39;m a Herodotus man through and through, but I can appreciate the Thycydidean perspective as well. Though I&#39;m not entirely sure what that perspective entails: how much of his work is prescriptive and how much of it is descriptive? He&#39;s obviously a skeptic when it comes to the supernatural, and there&#39;s very little room for morality in his history; is this an artifact of the lack of morality in the way the Athenian went about their affairs, or is this something Thuc projects onto them? In any case, while reading this, one must always keep in mind that the Athenians <em>lost</em>!</p><p>It&#39;s interesting to read an ancient historian write about battles with 60 hoplites and 20 archers, and that kind of accounting accuracy perfectly captures Thuc&#39;s personality.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>&quot;... For Athens alone of her contemporaries is found when tested to be greater than her reputation, and alone gives no occasion to her assailants to blush at the antagonist by whom they have been worsted, or to her subjects to question her title to rule by merit. Rather, the admiration of the present and succeeding ages will be ours, since we have not left our power without witness, but have shown it by mighty proofs; and far from needing a Homer for our eulogist, or other of his craft whose verses might charm for the moment only for the impression which they gave to melt at the touch of fact, we have forced every sea and land to be the highway of our daring, and everywhere, whether for evil or for good, have left imperishable monuments behind us. Such is the Athens for which these men, in the assertion of their resolve not to lose her, nobly fought and died; and well may every one of their survivors be ready to suffer in her cause.&quot;</p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/bb21_peregrine.jpg" class="floatright nofancybox"><p>J. A. Baker, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Peregrine-Anniversary-Afterword-Robert-Macfarlane/dp/0008216215?crid=2Q7DXIVYHCYPI&keywords=the+peregrine&qid=1646217962&sprefix=the+peregrine%2Caps%2C244&sr=8-2&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=c6fb80546938f747012191a5f2bf4ac8&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Peregrine</a></strong></p><p>10 years of obsessive, monomaniacal peregrine-watching in the East of England distilled to 200 pure, intense, astonishing pages. An incredibly rich dish that you can only eat so much of before needing to take a break. Reflects and contains nature both in its form and content. Somewhat reminiscent of Urne-Buriall in that it starts out in a dry, scientific tone and then reaches stylistic extremes later on.</p><p>Famously recommended by Werner Herzog (along with Virgil and <em>The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber</em>), and it is indeed extremely Herzogian. There&#39;s no green idealism here, the endless cycle of killing which sustains the peregrine is presented unapologetically. &quot;Beauty is vapour from the pit of death&quot;, Baker writes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>He hovered, and stayed still, striding on the crumbling columns of air, curved wings jerking and flexing. Five minutes he stayed there, fixed like a barb in the blue flesh of the sky. His body was still and rigid, his head turned from side to side, his tail fanned open and shut, his wings whipped and shuddered like canvas in the lash of the wind. He side-slipped to his left, paused, then glided round and down into what could only be the beginning of a tremendous stoop. There is no mistaking the menace of that first easy drifting fall. Smoothly, at an angle of fifty degrees, he descended; not slowly, but controlling his speed; gracefully, beautifully balanced. There was no abrupt change. The angle of his fall became gradually steeper till there was no angle left, but only a perfect arc. He curved over and slowly revolved, as though for delight, glorying in anticipation of the dive to come. His feet opened and gleamed golden, clutching up towards the sun. He rolled over, and they dulled, and turned towards the ground beneath, and closed again. For a thousand feet he fell, and curved, and slowly turned, and tilted upright. Then his speed increased, and he dropped vertically down. He had another thousand feet to fall, but now he fell sheer, shimmering down through dazzling sunlight, heart-shaped, like a heart in flames. He became smaller and darker, diving down from the sun. The partridge in the snow beneath looked up at the black heart dilating down upon him, and heard a hiss of wings rising to a roar. In ten seconds the hawk was down, and the whole splendid fabric, the arched reredos and immense fan-vaulting of his flight, was consumed and lost in the fiery maelstrom of the sky.</p><p>And for the partridge there was the sun suddenly shut out, the foul flailing blackness spreading wings above, the roar ceasing, the blazing knives driving in, the terrible white face descending, hooked and masked and horned and staring-eyed. And then the back-breaking agony beginning, and snow scattering from scuffling feet, and show filling the bill’s wide silent scream, till the merciful needle of the hawk’s beak notched in the straining neck and jerked the shuddering life away.</p><p>And for the hawk, resting now on the soft flaccid bulk of his prey, there was the rip and tear of choking feathers, and hot blood dripping from the hook of his beak, and rage dying slowly to a small hard core within.</p><p>And for the watcher, sheltered for centuries from such hunger and such rage, such agony and such fear, there is the memory of that sabring fall from the sky, and the vicarious joy of the guiltless hunter who kills only through his familiar, and wills him to be fed.</p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both"></div><h1 id="The-Worst"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2022/03/04/the-best-and-worst-books-i-read-in-2021/#The-Worst" class="headerlink" title="The Worst"></a>The Worst</h1><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/bb21_hazlitt.jpg" class="floatleft nofancybox"><p>William Hazlitt, <strong>Selected Writings</strong></p><p>I despise the style of his political writings. Puffed up, aiming to dazzle rather than illuminate. The cheap rhetoric of the ochlagogue. Actively offensive. The non-political writings are much better: they are merely unreadable and sophomoric. Hazlitt&#39;s entire aesthetic philosophy just boils down to &quot;art should imitate nature&quot; repeated over and over again, and I can&#39;t stand the way he expresses it.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>It is not denied that the people are best acquainted with their own wants, and most attached to their own interests. But then a question is started, as if the persons asking it were at a great loss for the answer,—Where are we to find the intellect of the people? Why, all the intellect that ever was is theirs. The public opinion expresses not only the collective sense of the whole people, but of all ages and nations, of all those minds that have devoted themselves to the love of truth and the good of mankind,—who have bequeathed their instructions, their hopes, and their example to posterity,—who have thought, spoke, written, acted, and suffered in the name and on the behalf of our common nature. All the greatest poets, sages, heroes, are ours originally, and by right.</p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/bb21_shadow.jpg" class="floatright nofancybox"><p>Carlos Ruiz Zafón, <strong>The Shadow of the Wind</strong></p><p>Just a dull airport novel. The coincidences pile on top of eachother as we are treated to interminable exposition dumps from improbable sources that conveniently know everything. Stylistically it tries too hard and achieves nothing.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Destiny is usually just around the corner. Like a thief, a hooker, or a lottery vendor: its three most common personifications. But what destiny does not do is home visits. You have to go for it.</p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/bb21_lightning.jpg" class="floatleft nofancybox"><p>Ada Palmer, <strong>Too Like the Lightning</strong></p><p>Love Palmer&#39;s blog but this book just wasn&#39;t for me. Even though I read plenty of older books, I found the affected faux-18thC style absolutely grating. The plot mostly seems to be based on the Star Wars prequels, with endless scenes of characters talking about the taxation of trade routes or some other similarly boring nonsense. And there&#39;s a magical boy thrown in there for good measure, as well.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>I could ask any contemporary here, ‘Are you a majority?’ and I know what he or she would answer: Of course not, Mycroft. I have a Hive, a race, a second language, a vocation and an avocation, hobbies of my own; add up my many strats and you will soon reduce me to a minority of one, and hence my happiness. I am unique, and proud of my uniqueness, and prouder still that, by being no majority, I ensure eternal peace. You lie, reader. There is one majority still entrenched in our commingled world, a great ‘us’ against a smaller ‘them.’ You will see it in time. I shall give only one hint—the deadliest majority is not something most of my contemporaries are, reader, it is something they are not.</p></div></blockquote>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In <em>Averroës&#39;s Search</em>, Borges tells the story of the Islamic philosopher Averroës trying, and failing, to understand Aristotle&#39;s writings on theater. Borges sums it up in the afterword:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>In the preceding tale, I have tried to narrate the process of failure, the process of defeat. I thought first of that archbishop of Canterbury who set himself the task of proving that God exists; then I thought of the alchemists who sought the philosopher’s stone; then, of he vain trisectors of the angle and squares of the circle. Then I reflected that a more poetic case than these would be a man who sets himself a goal that is not forbidden to other men, but is forbidden to him. I recalled Averroës, who, bounded within the circle of Islam, could never know the meaning of the words tragedy and comedy.</p></div></blockquote><p>History and literature offer many cases of ironically failed quests for knowledge.</p><p>Some phenomena disappear immediately once someone describes them. Douglas Adams wrote of a theory &quot;which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear&quot;. The modern world offers many such <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/11/the-phatic-and-the-anti-inductive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-inductive</a> cases, above all in the movements of the stock market: successful trading strategies tend to stop working after they become known. On a civilizational scale, Malthusianism became irrelevant right at the time someone was able to articulate the idea, and it seems that the moment we are able to improve ourselves through genetic engineering, we will be wiped out by our artificial creations.</p><p>A second type of ill-fated seeker is one who finds what he is looking for, but his goal is also a punishment. William Beckford, categorically rejecting Ulysses&#39; actions at the land of the Sirens (perhaps inspired by his own life, and perhaps commenting on all attempts to comprehend the universe) created the apostate Caliph Vathek whose obsessive quest for knowledge results in his damnation, and for whom Hell is both the object of desire and the punishment for that desire. There are those who argue that the libertine Beckford only adopted this biblical attitude against the Faustian spirit as an ironic orientalist façade, but the Caliph resists all attempts at interpretation.</p><p>Some seekers reach their goal, only to have it slip out of their hands. Scientists will occasionally chance on the right idea but lack the ability to prove it: Aristarchus of Samos was doomed by the apparent size of the stars and the lack of parallax. The Royal Navy discovered that lemons prevent scurvy, and then through terrible epistemic luck managed to <a href="https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2022/01/11/reality-is-very-weird-and-you-need-to-be-prepared-for-that/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lose that knowledge</a> over the course of the 19th century: lemons were replaced by limes low in vitamin C, but nobody noticed because the ships were faster. The problem only reappeared when polar explorers started suffering from scurvy despite bringing lime juice with them—and the answer was only discovered by the miraculously good luck of experimenting on guinea pigs, one of very few animals that don&#39;t produce vitamin C on their own.</p><p>Finally the most ironic case of them all, that of the Dalmatian archbishop and heretic Marco Antonio de Dominis: a seeker who is able to find the answer, but is condemned to believe it is false. De Dominis, a contemporary of Kepler (who wrote in favor of the lunar theory of tides) and Galileo (who mocked it), was also an amateur astronomer and wrote a book on the tides titled <em>Euripus</em>.</p><p>The archbishop begins by presenting both empirical and theoretical arguments in favor of the thesis that the earth is a sphere. He then describes the luni-solar theory of tides: he (correctly) writes that tides are caused by the combined gravitational action of the sun and the moon, (correctly) predicts that high tide occurs simultaneously at antipodal points, and (correctly) shows that the cycle of spring and neap tides can be explained by the combined action of the sun and moon. He also (correctly) deduces that the diurnal inequality between tides will be greatest when the moon is above the tropic of Cancer or Capricorn. Finally, de Dominis explains (incorrectly) that since the two daily tides are always equal to each other, the theory must be false. The heretical archbishop died behind the bars of the Castel Sant&#39;Angelo before his book could be published.</p>]]></content>

Bhattacharya approaches his subject by focusing on ideas. The first chapter takes care of JvN&#39;s early life, and the rest of the book is split up based on the subjects he worked on: mathematics, quantum mechanics, the nuclear bomb, computing, game theory, RAND, and artificial life. Large parts of the book (I&#39;d say about a third) are dedicated not to von Neumann but rather the work other people did based on his ideas. The game theory chapter, for example, covers Nash, Schelling, Aumann, etc. in economics, and John Maynard Smith, Price, Hamilton, etc. in evolutionary game theory. Bhattacharya is good at making all these technical subjects accessible without dumbing them down too much. JvN&#39;s personality, personal life, professional relationships, etc. on the other hand are given scant attention.</p><p>Overall it felt a bit too short. In less than 300 pages we get such a wide array of ideas, and the story of how they influenced so many people, that it often feels like we&#39;re just skimming the surface in a speedboat. I&#39;d like to take a deeper, more ponderous ride in a submarine some day.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Meetings-Remarkable-Manuscripts-Journeys-Medieval/dp/1594206112?crid=GVG9FQDFUW1H&keywords=meetings+with+remarkable+manuscripts&qid=1641223355&sprefix=meetings+with+remarkable+manuscri%2Caps%2C193&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=7c861eed6d26fbba6cc34f5e57a55962&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meetings with Remarkable Manuscripts</a></strong> by Christopher de Hamel. Fantastically gorgeous book, filled with high-quality prints of medieval manuscripts. Pleasant conversational style. Just lovely all around.

G. Sebald. A book of digressions. The frame is a walking tour of England, and on it are bolted various musings on Sir Thomas Browne, Joseph Konrad, silk manufacture, the Taiping rebellion, and so on. The subjects flow into each other so you don&#39;t know where one digression begins and the other ends. However, Sebald kind of undersells how interesting his subjects are; comparing his notes on FitzGerald to the <a href="https://www.gwern.net/docs/borges/1951-borges-theenigmaofedwardfitzgerald.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">famous Borges essay</a>, for example, makes me wonder how Sebald managed to turn such a fascinating subject into such a dull essay.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Conquistador-Hernan-Cortes-Montezuma-Aztecs/dp/0553384716?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1641224324&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=1241b9d1daaed1f4d25c01ea142d33b5&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Conquistador: Hernán Cortés, King Montezuma, and the Last Stand of the Aztecs</a></strong> by Buddy Levy. I didn&#39;t love the book (it felt a bit sloppy, and the style isn&#39;t great), but Cortes is an incredible character. The determination, the ingenuity, the absolute ruthlesness. When he murders his wife at the end of the book, all you can think is &quot;well of course he did&quot;. And self-aware too: &quot;I and my companions suffer from a disease of the heart that can be cured only with gold&quot;! Perhaps it is the contrast against the Aztecs that, in a way, softens his image? Going to try Prescott&#39;s <em>History of the Conquest of Mexico</em> next.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Over-Edge-World-Updated-Circumnavigation/dp/0062890484?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1641224351&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=639c5fba27da153bf3828a1880ed7c1b&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Over the Edge of the World: Magellan&#39;s Terrifying Circumnavigation of the Globe</a></strong> by Laurence Bergreen. Solid narrative pop history. Feels a bit rushed after the point of Magellan&#39;s death. Exciting, adventurous stuff as you&#39;d expect from the age of exploration.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Man-Moon-Voyages-Apollo-Astronauts/dp/014311235X?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1641224380&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=bd3685af47e97e53902613a9426d6337&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Man on the Moon: The Voyages of the Apollo Astronauts</a></strong> by Andrew Chaikin. Covers the entire thing plus a ton of backstory, very thorough (within its scope). Focused on the astronauts, and much of it is the preoduct of interviews with those astronauts, which is kind of obvious at many points as you&#39;re only getting one person&#39;s perspective on certain events. It would have been better with a broader, more objective view, in my opinion. The latter parts (after the first moon landing) include a surprising amount of geology! I read three books on the early space program this year and none of them was completely satisfying, I&#39;m still trying to find the Richard Rhodes of Apollo...</p></li></ul>]]></content>

The studies were sourced from all social science disciplines (economics, psychology, sociology, management, etc.) and were published between 2009 and 2018 (in other words, most of the sample came from the post-replication crisis era).</p><p>Only a subset of the papers will be replicated: ~100 papers were selected for a full replication, and another ~150 for a &quot;data replication&quot; in which the same methodology is applied to a different (but pre-existing) dataset.<span class="tooltip"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/11/18/how-i-made-10k-predicting-which-papers-will-replicate/#fn19752923461" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref19752923461">1</sup></a></span> Out of the target 250 replications, only about 100 were completed by the time the prizes were paid out.</p><h2 id="Surveys"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/11/18/how-i-made-10k-predicting-which-papers-will-replicate/#Surveys" class="headerlink" title="Surveys"></a>Surveys</h2><p>The surveys included a link to the paper, a brief summary of the claim selected for replication, the methodology, and a few statistical values (sample size, effect size, test statistic values, p-value). We then had to answer three questions:</p><ol><li>What is the probability of the paper replicating?</li><li>What proportion of other forecasters do you think will answer &gt;50% to the first question?</li><li>How plausible is the claim in general?</li></ol><p>The papers were split up into batches of 10, and the top 4 scorers in each batch won awards of $80, $40, $20, and $20 for a total of $4,800 per survey round.</p><p>The exact scoring method was not revealed in order to prevent gaming the system, but after the competition ended <a href="https://www.replicationmarkets.com/index.php/2020/10/21/surrogate-scoring-rules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the organizers wrote a technical blog post explaining the &quot;surrogate scoring rule&quot; approach</a>. Since the replications were not completed yet, scoring predictions had to be done without reference to the &quot;ground truth&quot;; instead they generated a &quot;surrogate outcome&quot; based on all the survey answers and used that to score the predictions.<span class="tooltip"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/11/18/how-i-made-10k-predicting-which-papers-will-replicate/#fn19752923462" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref19752923462">2</sup></a></span></p><h2 id="Markets"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/11/18/how-i-made-10k-predicting-which-papers-will-replicate/#Markets" class="headerlink" title="Markets"></a>Markets</h2><p>Every user started each round with 1 point per claim (so typically 300).<span class="tooltip"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/11/18/how-i-made-10k-predicting-which-papers-will-replicate/#fn19752923463" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref19752923463">3</sup></a></span> These points were the currency used to buy &quot;shares&quot; for every claim. Long share positions pay out if the paper replicates successfully and short positions pay out if it does not. Like a normal stock market, if you bought shares at a low price and the price went up, you could sell those shares for a profit.</p><p>The starting price of each claim was based on its p-value:</p><ul><li>p&lt;.05: 30%</li><li>p&lt;.01: 40%</li><li>p&lt;.001: 80%</li></ul><p>The market did not operate like a typical stock market (ie a continuous double auction); instead, they used Robin Hanson&#39;s <a href="http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/mktscore.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule</a> which allows users to trade without a counterparty.<span class="tooltip"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/11/18/how-i-made-10k-predicting-which-papers-will-replicate/#fn19752923464" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref19752923464">4</sup></a></span> Effectively it works as an automated market maker, making it costlier to trade the more extreme the price: taking a claim from 50% to 51% was cheap, while taking it from 98% to 99% was very expensive. Without any order book depth, prices could be rather volatile as it didn&#39;t take much for a single person to significantly shift the price on a claim; this also created profitable trading opportunities.</p><p>The payout for the markets was about $14k per round, awarded in proportion to winning shares in the papers selected for replication. Given the target of 250 replications, that means about 8% of the claims would actually resolve. The small number of actually completed replications, however, caused some issues: round 9, for example, only had 2 (out of the target 25) replications actually pay out.</p><h1 id="Early-Steps-A-Simple-Model"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/11/18/how-i-made-10k-predicting-which-papers-will-replicate/#Early-Steps-A-Simple-Model" class="headerlink" title="Early Steps - A Simple Model"></a>Early Steps - A Simple Model</h1><p>I didn&#39;t take the first round very seriously, and I had a horrible flu during the second round, so I only really started playing in round 3. I remembered Tetlock writing that &quot;it is impossible to find any domain in which humans clearly outperformed crude extrapolation algorithms, less still sophisticated statistical ones&quot;, so I decided to start with a statistical model to help me out.</p><p>This felt like a perfect occasion for a centaur approach (combining human judgment with a model), as there was plenty of quantitative data, but also lots of qualitative factors that are hard to model. For example, some papers with high p-values were nevertheless obviously going to replicate, due to how plausible the hypothesis was a priori.<span class="tooltip"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/11/18/how-i-made-10k-predicting-which-papers-will-replicate/#fn19752923465" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref19752923465">5</sup></a></span></p><p>Luckily someone had already collected the relevant data and built a model.<span class="tooltip"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/11/18/how-i-made-10k-predicting-which-papers-will-replicate/#fn19752923466" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref19752923466">6</sup></a></span> <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0225826" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Altmejd et al.

I started by reading the summary of the study on the RM website (which included the abstract, a description of the selected claim, sample size, p-value, and effect size). After that I skimmed the paper itself. If I didn&#39;t understand the methodology I checked the methods and/or conclusions, but the vast majority of papers were just straight regressions, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ANOVA</a>s, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_equation_modeling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEM</a>s. The most important information was almost always in the table with the main statistical results.</p><p>The factors I took into account, in rough order of importance:</p><ul><li><strong>p-value</strong>. Try to find the actual p-value, they are often not reported. Many papers will just give stars for &lt;.05 and &lt;.01, but sometimes &lt;.01 means 0.0000001! There&#39;s a shocking number of papers that only report coefficients and asterisks—no SEs, no CIs, no t-stats.</li><li><strong>Power</strong>. Ideally you&#39;ll do a proper power analysis, but I just eyeballed it.</li><li><strong>Plausibility</strong>. This is the most subjective part of the judgment and it can make an enormous difference. Some broad guidelines:<ul><li>People respond to incentives.</li><li>Good things tend to be correlated with good things and negatively correlated with bad things.</li><li>Subtle interventions do not have huge effects.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Pre-registration</strong>. Huge plus. Ideally you want to check if the plan was actually followed.</li><li><strong>Interaction</strong> effect. They tend to be especially underpowered.</li><li><strong>Other research</strong> on the same/similar questions, tests, scales, methodologies—this can be difficult for non-specialists, but the track record of a theory or methodology is important. Beware publication bias.</li><li><strong>Methodology</strong> - RCT/RDD/DID good. IV depends, many are crap. Various natural-/quasi-experiments: some good, some bad (often hard to replicate). Lab experiments, neutral. Approaches that don&#39;t deal with causal identification depend heavily on prior plausibility.</li><li><strong>Robustness</strong> checks: how does the claim hold up across specifications, samples, experiments, etc.</li><li>Signs of a <strong>fishing expedition/researcher degrees of freedom</strong>. If you see a gazillion potential outcome variables and that they picked the one that happened to have p&lt;0.05, that&#39;s what we in the business call a &quot;red flag&quot;. Look out for stuff like ad hoc quadratic terms.</li><li><strong>Suspiciously transformed variables</strong>. Continuous variables put into arbitrary bins are a classic p-hacking technique.</li><li><strong>General propensity for error</strong>/inconsistency in measurements. Fluffy variables or experiments involving wrangling 9 month old babies, for example.</li></ul><p>Things that don&#39;t matter for replication but matter very much in the real world:</p><ul><li>Causal identification! The plausibility of a paper&#39;s causal identification strategy is generally orthogonal to its chances of replicating.</li><li>Generalizability. Lab experiments are replicated in other labs.</li></ul><p>Some papers were completely outside my understanding, and I didn&#39;t spend any time trying to understand them. Jargon-heavy cognitive science papers often fell into this category. I just gave a forecast close to the default and marked them as &quot;low confidence&quot; in my notes, then avoided trading them during the market round. On the other hand, sometimes I got the feeling that the jargon was just there to cover up bullshit (leadership studies, I&#39;m looking at you) in which case I docked points for stuff I didn&#39;t understand. The epistemological problem of how to determine which jargon is legit and which is not, is left as an exercise to the reader.</p><h2 id="Pour-exemple"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/11/18/how-i-made-10k-predicting-which-papers-will-replicate/#Pour-exemple" class="headerlink" title="Pour exemple"></a>Pour exemple</h2><p>The data from Replication Markets are still embargoed, so I can&#39;t give you any real examples. Instead, I have selected a couple of papers that were not part of the project but are similar enough.</p><h3 id="Ex-1-Criminology"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/11/18/how-i-made-10k-predicting-which-papers-will-replicate/#Ex-1-Criminology" class="headerlink" title="Ex. 1: Criminology"></a><strong>Ex. 1: Criminology</strong></h3><p>My first example is a criminology paper which purports to investigate the effect of parenting styles on criminal offending. Despite using causal language throughout, the paper has no causal identification strategy whatsoever. If criminologists had better GRE scores this nonsense would never have been published. The most relevant bits of the abstract:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>The present study used path analyses and prospective, longitudinal data from a sample of 318 African American men to examine the effects of eight parenting styles on adult crime. Furthermore, we investigated the extent to which significant parenting effects are mediated by criminogenic schemas, negative emotions, peer affiliations, adult transitions, and involvement with the criminal justice system. Consonant with the study hypotheses, the results indicated that [...] parenting styles low on demandingness but high on responsiveness or corporal punishment were associated with a robust increase in risk for adult crime.</p></div></blockquote><p>The selected claim is the effect of abusive parenting (the &quot;abusive&quot; parenting style involves &quot;high corporal punishment&quot; but low &quot;demandingness&quot; and &quot;responsiveness&quot;) on offending; I have highlighted the outcome in the main regression table below. While the asterisks only say p&lt;.01, the text below indicates that the p-value is actually &lt;.001.</p><p>Make your own guess about the probability of replication and then scroll down to mine below.</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/howwon_criminologyabusive.png"><p>I&#39;d give this claim 78%. The results are obviously confounded, but they&#39;re confounded in a way that is fairly intuitive, and we would expect the replication to be confounded in the exact same way. Abusive parents are clearly more likely to have kids who become criminals. Although they don&#39;t give us the exact t-stat, the p-value is very low. On the negative side the sample size (318 people spread over 8 different parenting styles) isn&#39;t that big, I&#39;m a bit worried about variance in the classification of parenting styles, and there&#39;s a chance that the (non-causal) relation between abusive parenting and offending could be lost in the controls.</p><p>This is a classic example of &quot;just because it replicates doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s good&quot;, and also a prime example of why the entire field of criminology should be scrapped.</p><h3 id="Ex-2-Environmental-Psychology"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/11/18/how-i-made-10k-predicting-which-papers-will-replicate/#Ex-2-Environmental-Psychology" class="headerlink" title="Ex. 2: Environmental Psychology"></a><strong>Ex. 2: Environmental Psychology</strong></h3><p>My second example is an &quot;environmental psychology&quot; paper about collective guilt and how people act in response to global warming.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>The present research examines whether collective guilt for an ingroup’s collective greenhouse gas emissions mediates the effects of beliefs about the causes and effects of global warming on willingness to engage in mitigation behavior.</p></div></blockquote><p>N=72 people responded to a survey after a manipulation, on a) the causes and b) the importance of the effects of climate change. The selected claim is that &quot;participants in the <em>human cause-minor effect</em> condition reported more collective guilt than did participants in the other three conditions (b* = .50, p &lt;.05)&quot;. Again, make your own guess before scrolling down.</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/howwon_climatechange.png"><p>I&#39;d go with 23% on this one. Large p-value, interaction effect, relatively small sample, and a result that does not seem all that plausible a priori. The lack of significance on the Cause/Effect parameters alone is also suspicious, as is the lack of signifiance on mitigation intentions. Lots of opportunities to find <em>some</em> significant effect here!</p><h1 id="Spreadsheets"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/11/18/how-i-made-10k-predicting-which-papers-will-replicate/#Spreadsheets" class="headerlink" title="Spreadsheets"></a>Spreadsheets</h1><p>The worst part of Replication Markets was the user interface: it did not offer any way to keep track of one&#39;s survey answers, so in order to effectively navigate the market rounds I had to manually keep track of all the predictions. There was also no way to track changes in the value of one&#39;s shares, so again that had to be done manually in order to exit successful trades and find new opportunities. The initial solution was giant spreadsheets:</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/howwon_predictionmarkets_studies.png"><p>Since the initial prices were set depending on the claim&#39;s p-value, I knew ahead of time which claims would be most mispriced at the start of trading (and that&#39;s where the greatest opportunities were). So a second spreadsheet was used to track the best initial trades.<span class="tooltip"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/11/18/how-i-made-10k-predicting-which-papers-will-replicate/#fn197529234611" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref197529234611">11</sup></a></span> The final column tracks how those trades worked out by the end of the market round; as you can see not all of them were successful (including some significant &quot;overshoots&quot;), but in general I had a good hit rate. As you can see, there were far more &quot;longs&quot; than &quot;shorts&quot; at the start: these were mostly results that were highly plausible a priori but had failed to get a p-value below 0.001.</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/howwon_prep.png"><p><em>[&quot;Final&quot; is my estimate, &quot;default&quot; is the starting price, &quot;mkt&quot; is the final market price]</em></p><p>Finally, a third spreadsheet was used to track live trading during the market rounds. There was no clean way of getting the prices from the RM website to my sheet, so I copy/pasted everything, parsed it, and then inserted the values into the sheet. I usually did that a few times per day (more often at the start, since that was where most trading activity was concentrated). The claims were then ranked by the difference between my own estimate and the market. My current share positions were listed next to them so I knew what I needed to trade. The &quot;Change&quot; column listed the change in price since the last update, so I could easily spot big changes (which usually meant new trading opportunities).</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/howwon_spreadheet.png"><p><em>[&quot;Live&quot; is the current market price, &quot;My&quot; is my estimate, &quot;Shares&quot; is the current position]</em></p><h1 id="Forget-the-Model"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/11/18/how-i-made-10k-predicting-which-papers-will-replicate/#Forget-the-Model" class="headerlink" title="Forget the Model!"></a>Forget the Model!</h1><p>After the third round I took a look at the data to evaluate the model and there were two main problems:</p><ul><li>My own errors (prediction minus market price) were very similar with the errors of the model:</li></ul><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/howwon_memodelerrors.png"><ul><li>The model failed badly at high-probability claims, and failed to improve overall performance. Here&#39;s the root mean square error vs market prices, grouped by p-value:</li></ul><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/howwon_rmsemodel.png"><p>Of course what the model was actually trying to predict was replication, not the market price. But market prices were the only guide I had to go by (we didn&#39;t even get feedback on survey performance), and I believed the market was right and the model was wrong when it came to low-p-value claims.</p><p>What would happen if everyone tried to optimize for predicting market prices? I imagine we could have gotten into weird feedback loops, causing serious disconnects between market prices and actual replication probability. In practice I don&#39;t think that was an issue though.</p><p>If I had kept going with the model, I had some improvements in mind:</p><ul><li>Add some sort of non-linear p-value term (or go with z-scores instead).</li><li>Quantify my subjective judgment of &quot;plausibility&quot; and add it as another variable in the model.</li><li>Use the round 3 market data of 300 papers (possibly with extremized prices) to estimate a new model, which would more than triple my N from the original 131 papers. But I wasn&#39;t sure how to combine categorical data from the previous replications and probabilities from the prices in a single model.<span class="tooltip"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/11/18/how-i-made-10k-predicting-which-papers-will-replicate/#fn197529234612" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref197529234612">12</sup></a></span></li></ul><p>At this point it didn&#39;t seem worth the effort, especially given all the extra data collection work involved. So, from round 4 onward I abandoned the model completely and relied only on my own guesses.</p><h1 id="Playing-the-Game"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/11/18/how-i-made-10k-predicting-which-papers-will-replicate/#Playing-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="Playing the Game"></a>Playing the Game</h1><p>Two basic facts dictated the trading strategy:</p><ol><li>Only a small % of claims will actually be replicated and pay out.</li><li>Most claims are approximately correctly priced.</li></ol><p>It follows that smart traders make many trades, move the price by a small amount (the larger your trade the larger the price impact), and have a diversified portfolio. The inverse of this rule can be used to identify bad traders: anyone moving the price by a huge amount and concentrating their portfolio in a small number of bets is almost certainly a bad trader, and one can profitably fade their trades.</p><p>Another source of profitable trades was the start of the round. Many claims were highly mispriced, but making a profit depended on getting to them first, which was not always easy since everyone more or less wanted to make the same trades. Beyond that, I focused on simply allocating most of my points toward the most-mispriced claims.</p><p>I split the trading rounds into two phases:</p><ol><li><p>Trading based on the expected price movement.</p></li><li><p>At the very end of the round, trading based on my actual estimate of replication probability.</p></li></ol><p>Usually these two aspects would coincide, but there were certain types of claims that I believed were systematically mispriced by other market participants.<span class="tooltip"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/11/18/how-i-made-10k-predicting-which-papers-will-replicate/#fn197529234613" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref197529234613">13</sup></a></span> Trading those in the hope of making profits during the market round didn&#39;t work out, so I only allocated points toward them at the end.</p><p>Another factor to take into consideration was that not all claims were equally likely to be selected for replication. In some cases it was pretty obvious that a paper would be difficult or impossible to replicate directly. I was happy to trade them, but by the end of the round I excluded them from the portfolio.<span class="tooltip"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/11/18/how-i-made-10k-predicting-which-papers-will-replicate/#fn197529234614" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref197529234614">14</sup></a></span></p><p>Buying the most mispriced items also means you&#39;re stuck with a somewhat contrarian portfolio, which can be dangerous if you&#39;re wrong. Given the flat payout structure of the market, following the herd was not necessarily a bad idea. Sometimes if a claim traded strongly against my own forecast, I would lower the weight assigned to it or even avoid it completely. Suppose you think a study has a 30% chance of replicating, and a liquid market insists it has a 70% chance—how do you revise your forecast?</p><h1 id="Reacting-to-Feedback"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/11/18/how-i-made-10k-predicting-which-papers-will-replicate/#Reacting-to-Feedback" class="headerlink" title="Reacting to Feedback"></a>Reacting to Feedback</h1><p>After every round I generated a bunch of graphs that were designed to help me understand the market and improve my own forecasts. This was complicated by the fact that there were no replication results—all I had to go by were the market prices, and they could be misleading.</p><p>Among other things, I compared means, standard deviations, and quartiles of my own predictions vs the market; looked at my means and RMSE grouped by p-value and discipline; plotted the distribution of forecasts, and error vs market price; etc.</p><p>One standard pattern of prediction markets is that extremizing the market prediction makes it better. Simplistically, you can think of the market price being determined by informed traders and uninformed/noise traders. The latter pull the price toward the middle, so the best prediction is going to be (on average) more extreme than the market&#39;s. This is made worse in the case of Replication Markets because of the LMSR algorithm which makes shares much more expensive the closer you get to 0 or 100%. So you can often improve on things by just extremizing the market forecast, and I always checked to see if my predictions were on the extremizing side vs the market.</p><p>Here you can see the density plots of my own vs the market forecasts, split up by p-value category. (The vertical line is the default starting price for each group.)</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/howwon_density.png"><p>And here&#39;s the same data in scatterplot form:</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/howwon_mevsmarketscatter.png" title="My predictions vs the market." alt="My predictions vs the market."><span class="image-caption">My predictions vs the market.</span> <img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/howwon_disdiffs.png" title="Difference between my forecasts and the market, by discipline." alt="Difference between my forecasts and the market, by discipline.

The market was more confident in results from economics, at least in round 3.</span><p>Over time my own predictions converged with the market. I&#39;m not entirely sure how to interpret this trend. Perhaps I was influenced by the market and subtly changed my predictions based on what I saw. Did that make me more accurate or less? It&#39;s unclear, and based on the limited number of actual replication results it&#39;s impossible to tell. Another possibility is that the changing composition of forecasters over time made <em>the market</em> more similar to me?</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/howwon_rmsebyround.png"><h1 id="Automated-Trading"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/11/18/how-i-made-10k-predicting-which-papers-will-replicate/#Automated-Trading" class="headerlink" title="Automated Trading"></a>Automated Trading</h1><p>I think a lot of my success was due to putting in more effort than others were willing to. And by &quot;putting in effort&quot; I mean automating it so I don&#39;t have to put in any effort. In round 6 the trading API was introduced; at that point I dropped the spreadsheets and quickly threw together a desktop application (using C# &amp; WPF) that utilized the API and included both automated and manual trading.<span class="tooltip"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/11/18/how-i-made-10k-predicting-which-papers-will-replicate/#fn197529234615" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref197529234615">15</sup></a></span> Automating things also made more frequent data updates possible: instead of copy-pasting a giant webpage a few times a day, now everything updated automatically once every 15 minutes.</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/howwon_traderscreenshot.png"><p>The main area on the left is the current state of the market and my portfolio, with papers sorted by how mispriced they are. <em>Mkt</em> is the current market price, <em>My</em> is my forecast, <em>Position</em> is the number of shares owned, <em>Liq. Value</em> is the number of points I could get by exiting this position, <em>WF</em> is a weight factor for the portfolio optimization, and <em>Hist</em> shows the price history of that claim.</p><p>On the right we have pending orders, a list of the latest orders executed on the market, plus logging on the bottom.</p><p>I used a simple weighting algorithm with a few heuristics sprinkled on top. Below you can see the settings for the weighting, plus a graph of the portfolio weights allocated by claim (the most-mispriced claims are on the left).</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/howwon_settings.png"><p>To start with I simply generated weights proportional to the square of the difference between the current market price and my target price (<em>Exponent</em>). Then,</p><ul><li>multiplied that by a per-study weight factor (<em>WF</em> in the main screen),</li><li>multiplied that by <em>ExtremeValueMultiplier</em> for claims with extreme prices (&lt;8% or &gt;96%),</li><li>removed any claims with a difference smaller than the <em>CutOff</em>,</li><li>removed any claims with weight below <em>MinThreshold</em>,</li><li>limited the maximum weight to <em>MaxPosition</em>,</li><li>and disallowed any trading for claims that were already close to their target weight (<em>NoWeightChangeBandwidth</em>).</li></ul><p>There was also another factor to take into consideration: the RM organizers ran some bots of their own. One simply traded randomly, while the other systematically moved prices back toward their default values. This created a predictable price pressure which had to be taken into account and potentially exploited: the <em>DefDiffPenalizationFactor</em> lowered the weight of claims that were expected to have adverse movements due to the bots.</p><p>Fading large price movements was automated, and I kept a certain amount of free points available so that I could take advantage of them quickly. Finally, turning the weighting algorithm into trades was fairly simple. If the free points fell below a threshold, the bot would automatically sell some shares. Most trades did not warrant a reaction however, and I had a semi-automated system for bringing the portfolio in line with the generated weights, which involved hitting a button to generate the orders and then firing them off.</p><h1 id="High-Frequency-Trading"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/11/18/how-i-made-10k-predicting-which-papers-will-replicate/#High-Frequency-Trading" class="headerlink" title="High Frequency Trading"></a>High Frequency Trading</h1><p>When there are a) obviously profitable trades to be made and b) multiple people competing for them, it&#39;s very easy to get into a competitive spiral that pushes speeds down to the minimum allowed by the available technology. That&#39;s how a replication prediction market ended up being all about shaving milliseconds off of trading algos.</p><p>By round 9 another player (named CPM) had also automated his trades and he was faster than me so he took all my profits by reacting to profitable opportunities before I could get my orders in—we were now locked in an HFT latency race. There was only one round left so I didn&#39;t want to spend too much time on it, but I did a small rewrite of my trading app so it could run on linux (thanks, .NET Core), which involved splitting it into a client (with the UI) and a server (with the trading logic), and patching in some networking so I could control it remotely.<span class="tooltip"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/11/18/how-i-made-10k-predicting-which-papers-will-replicate/#fn197529234616" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref197529234616">16</sup></a></span> Then, I threw it up on my VPS which had lower ping to the RM servers.</p><p>When I first ran my autotrader, I polled the API for new trades once every 15 minutes<span class="tooltip"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/11/18/how-i-made-10k-predicting-which-papers-will-replicate/#fn197529234617" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref197529234617">17</sup></a></span>. Now it was a fight for milliseconds. Unfortunately placing the autotrader on the VPS wasn&#39;t enough, the latency was still fairly high and CPM crushed me again, though by a smaller margin this time. Sometimes I got lucky and snagged an opportunity before he could get to it though.</p><h1 id="The-Results"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/11/18/how-i-made-10k-predicting-which-papers-will-replicate/#The-Results" class="headerlink" title="The Results"></a>The Results</h1><p>In money terms, I made $6640 from the surveys and $4020 from the markets for a total of $10,660 (out of a total prizepool of about $190k).</p><p>In terms of the actual replication results, the detailed outcomes are still embargoed, so we&#39;ll have to wait until next summer (at least) to get a look at them. Some broad stats can be shared however: the market predicted a 54% chance of replication on average—and 54% of the replications succeeded (the market isn&#39;t <em>that</em> good, it got lucky).</p><p>Of 107 claims that resolved, I have data on 31 which I made money on. For the rest I either had no shares, or had shares in the incorrect direction. Since I only have data on the successes, there&#39;s no way to judge my performance right now.</p><p><strong>Survey vs Market Payouts</strong></p><p>The survey round payout scheme was top-heavy, and small variations in performance resulted in large differences in winnings. The market payout on the other hand was more or less communistic. Everyone gets the same number of points; and it was difficult to either gain or lose too many of them in the two weeks of trading. As a result, the final distribution of prizes is rather flat. At best a good forecaster might increase earnings by ~10% by exploiting mispricings, plus a bit more through intelligent trading. The Gini coefficient of the survey payouts was 0.76, while the Gini of the market payouts was 0.63 (this is confounded by different participation levels, but you get the point).</p><p>This was backwards. I think one of the most important aspects of &quot;ideal&quot; prediction markets is that informed traders can compound their winnings, while uninformed traders go broke. The market mechanism works well because the feedback loop weeds out those who are consistently wrong. This element was completely missing in the RM project. I think the market payout scheme should have been top-heavy, and should have allowed for compounding across rounds, while the survey round should have been flatter in order to incentivize broader participation.</p><h1 id="Conclusion"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/11/18/how-i-made-10k-predicting-which-papers-will-replicate/#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1><p>If the market had kept going, my next step would have been to use other people&#39;s trades to update my estimates. The idea was to look at their past trades to determine how good they were (based on the price movement following their trade), then use the magnitude of their trades to weigh their confidence in each trade, and finally incorporate that info in my own forecast. Overall it&#39;s fascinating how even a relatively simple market like this has tons of little nuances, exploitable regularities, and huge potential for modeling and trading strategies of all sorts.</p><p>In the end, are subsidized markets necessary for predicting replication? Probably not. The predictions will(?) be used to train our AI replacements, and I believe SCORE&#39;s other replication prediction project, <a href="https://replicats.research.unimelb.edu.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repliCATS</a>, successfully used (cheaper) discussion groups. It will be interesting to see how the two approaches compare. Tetlock&#39;s research shows that working as part of a team increases the accuracy of forecasters, so it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if repliCATS comes out ahead. A combination of teams (aided by ML) and markets would be the best, but at some point the marginal accuracy gains aren&#39;t really worth the extra effort and money.</p><p>I strongly believe that identifying reliable research is <em>not</em> the main problem in social science today. The real issue is making sure unreliable research is not produced in the first place, and if it <em>is</em> produced, to make sure it does not receive money and citations. And for that you have to change The Incentives.</p><hr><p>PS. Shoot me an email if you&#39;re doing anything interesting and/or lucrative in forecasting.</p><p>PPS.

Not until after 1850 had the high-pressure engine become widespread and efficient enough to be deployed in factories and on rail engines that these numbers each rose to .2 percent. A <em>century</em> passed between James Watt’s patent—the first revolutionary “general purpose technology”—and its maximum realization in TFP growth.</p></div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Soaring population growth in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries threatened the island with a Malthusian demographic catastrophe.

Re-read. What was that Coleridge quip? &quot;All men are born Herodotians or Thucydideans&quot;? Something like that. Anyway, I was definitely born a Herodotian. Thucydides is a historian with the soul of an accountant. Still, there are things to appreciate in that attitude: while most ancient historians never saw an army smaller than 400,000, he&#39;s happy to tell you about engagements with 60 hoplites and 20 archers. And keeping track of a myriad engagements, covering Asia Minor, Greece, and Italy, over the span of multiple decades is extremely impressive.</p><p>How prescriptive is Thuc&#39;s realpolitik? I&#39;m not entirely sure, it certainly didn&#39;t do the Athenians any good. He&#39;s obviously a skeptic when it comes to the supernatural, and there&#39;s very little room for morality in his history; is this an artifact of the lack of morality in the way the Athenian went about their affairs, or is this something Thuc projects onto them? One interesting point is that his story draws on the structure of tragedy: the hubris of the Sicilian expedition is ultimately punished; the players seem to lack any ability to change course. Perhaps morality plays no role in this history because Thuc views the path taken by each polis as <em>deterministic</em>. (This applies both to the &quot;Thucydides trap&quot; specifically, and also more generally).</p><p>On the question of direct democracy as a system of government things are a bit clearer as Thuc doesn&#39;t hide his views. He&#39;s short on alternatives though; the traditional polis obviously can&#39;t cope with the environment of the 4th century, but Thuc can&#39;t really see beyond it.</p><p>There are apparently some people who think Thucydides influenced the Neoconservatives, and I find that utterly absurd. Thuc is extraordinarily cynical when it comes to &quot;spreading freedom&quot;-style justifications for war, and if there&#39;s any realpolitik involved in spending trillions so that Afghan women can get gender studies degrees for 20 years before the Taliban come back, I&#39;m not seeing it.</p><p>One of the things that stand out is how bad the Greeks are at war. Reading Thuc, you&#39;re constantly thinking &quot;well of course these guys got rolled by the Romans&quot;. How did they beat the Persians so hard? Sieges seem to be a sticking point (something Phillip II turned out to be quite good at), so perhaps the open battles against the Persians played into their hands, or perhaps it was simply a matter of mismatched unit compositions. On the other hand the Athenians were extraordinarily persistent; even after the plague and the Sicilian disaster they still kept going for years, possibly only losing due to the Persian money flowing into the Spartan coffers.</p><p>If you haven&#39;t read any histories of the Pelopponesian war, this is highly recommended, just keep in mind it&#39;s very unfinished. Get the Landmark edition.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Swerve-How-World-Became-Modern/dp/0393343405?dchild=1&keywords=the+swerve&qid=1633048231&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=482801a338a30053f3f01c15c7d5cb9a&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Swerve: How the World Became Modern</a></strong>, by Stephen Greenblatt. This book has an incredibly ambitious thesis: it argues that the world became modern due to the rediscovery of Lucretius&#39; <em>De Rerum Natura</em>. Unfortunately the evidence presented in favor of that thesis is pretty weak, and the book suddenly ends right as it starts to get into a groove. Still, it&#39;s fairly entertaining and has a ton of interesting anecdotes from the life of Poggio Bracciolini (the man who rediscovered Lucretius).</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Origin-Species-Everymans-Library-Classics/dp/1857152581?dchild=1&keywords=The+Origin+of+Species+everyman&qid=1633048213&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=c81c68353744c2314526516fb2bcf178&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Origin of Species</a></strong>, by Charles Darwin. A fairly dry read, its value today mainly lies in its documentation of the discovery of evolution, and in showing how Darwin could reason his way forward despite rather limited means (not even an inkling of DNA!). It was cool to see the role geology played in the development of evolutionary theory, and there&#39;s a very interesting passage (at the end of the chapter ON THE IMPERFECTION OF THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD) in which Darwin <em>almost</em> invents plate tectonics based on the geographical distribution of species. It&#39;s difficult to recommend: if you want to learn about evolution, pick up a modern textbook; if you&#39;re interested in the history of science you should probably read a historian; and if you just want to read something cool by Charles Darwin, pick up his Beagle adventure.</p></li></ul><h3 id="Fiction"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/10/04/links-and-what-ive-been-reading-q3-2021/#Fiction" class="headerlink" title="Fiction"></a>Fiction</h3><ul><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Upon-Deep-Zones-Thought/dp/0812515285?&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=4cd132bb2522294b09d8f5180751101d&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Fire Upon the Deep</a></strong>, by Vernor Vinge. Some pretty cool worldbuilding, with a universe divided into zones where different levels of technology are possible (the highest one is filled with Gods who quickly commit suicide). One of the main alien races is a sentient houseplant riding a roomba (seriously).

A new novel in the Revelation Space universe, unfortunately it&#39;s also the worst novel in the Revelation Space universe. It&#39;s a bit like a horror theme park, going from one ride to the next with little to no connective tissue between them. Even worse, many of the rides are completely nonsensical given the setting (humanity has almost been completely wiped out by the inhibitors). The two main characters are completely uninteresting, their dialogue is annoying, and the revelations of their backstory are completely predictable.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Crash-Novel-J-G-Ballard/dp/1250171512?dchild=1&keywords=ballard+crash&qid=1633048060&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=a0b770f15340f6bf85f8a5bfec194335&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crash</a></strong>, by J. G. Ballard. Holy mother of Christ, this is an experience. A blunt tool that beats you into submission through drone-like repetitiveness. Truly a novel that lives up to its reputation (one publisher&#39;s reader wrote: &quot;This author is beyond psychiatric help. Do Not Publish!&quot;). What images! A peerless examination of the intersection between sex and technology. The Cronenberg film gets the imagery right, but the languid, whispered tempo is completely wrong.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I found Giorgio Vasari through <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Civilization-Renaissance-Italy-Penguin-Classics-dp-014044534X/dp/014044534X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=fd3b3462f722c638b469707c909dcac5&language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Burckhardt</a><span class="tooltip"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/09/17/book-review-the-lives-of-the-most-excellent-painters-sculptors-and-architects/#fn15039362641" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref15039362641">1</sup></a></span> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dawn-Decadence-Present-Western-Cultural/dp/0060928832/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=From+Dawn+to+Decadence&qid=1590853931&s=books&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=2cd17c1ad57f3f121c3b89a89009cef8&language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Barzun</a>. The latter writes: &quot;Vasari, impelled by the unexampled artistic outburst of his time, divided his energies between his profession of painter and builder in Florence and biographer of the modern masters in the three great arts of design. His huge collection of Lives, which is a delight to read as well as a unique source of cultural history, was an amazing performance in an age that lacked organized means of research. [...] Throughout, Vasari makes sure that his reader will appreciate the enhanced human powers shown in the works that he calls &quot;good painting&quot; in parallel with &quot;good letters.&quot;&quot;</p><p>Vasari was mainly a painter, but also worked as an architect. He was not the greatest artist in the world, but he had a knack for ingratiating himself with the rich and powerful, so his career was quite successful. Besides painting, he also cared a lot about conservation: both the physical preservation of works and the conceptual preservation of the fame and biographies of artists. He gave a kind of immortality to many lost paintings and sculptures by describing them to us in his book.</p><p>His <em>Lives</em> are a collection of more than 180 biographies of Italian artists, starting with Cimabue (1240-1302) and reaching a climax with Michelangelo Buonarroti (1475-1564). They&#39;re an invaluable resource, as there is very little information available about these people other than his book; his biography of Botticelli is 8 pages long, yet on Botticelli&#39;s wikipedia page, Vasari is mentioned 36 times.</p><p>He was a straight-laced man surrounded on all sides by wild and eccentric artists. While Vasari was a sober businessman, always delivering his work on time, the people he was writing about were usually tempestuous madmen who would take commissions and leave the work unfinished, or go off on the slightest affront and start hacking apart their own works. Even of the great Leonardo he writes that &quot;through his comprehension of art, [he] began many things and never finished one of them&quot;.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>The greater part of the craftsmen who had lived up to that time had received from nature a certain element of savagery and madness, which, besides making them strange and eccentric, had brought it about that very often there was revealed in them rather the obscure darkness of vice than the brightness and splendour of those virtues that make men immortal.</p></div></blockquote><p>Many of them were undone by their love of food, drink, and/or women:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>...when his dear friend Agostino Chigi commissioned him to paint the first loggia in his palace, Raffaello was not able to give much attention to his work, on account of the love that he had for his mistress.</p></div></blockquote><p>Gwern&#39;s review of the <a href="https://www.gwern.net/reviews/Books#the-autobiography-of-benvenuto-cellini-cellini-1999" target="_blank" rel="noopener">autobiography of Cellini</a> (which includes the words &quot;aside from the demonology and weather-controlling&quot;) should give you a taste of what these guys were like.</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/vasari_priceofgreatness.png" width="568" height="376" title="price of greatness" alt="Arnold M. Ludwig, The Price of Greatness: Resolving the Creativity and Madness Controversy"><span class="image-caption">Arnold M. Ludwig, The Price of Greatness: Resolving the Creativity and Madness Controversy</span><p>Vasari&#39;s approach to the truth can be described as loose, if not gossipy. Many of the lives include fabricated elements, sometimes obviously so: I doubt anyone ever believed the story of Cimabue taking on Giotto as a pupil after seeing him scratch a painting on a stone. One of the most striking tales is the murder of Domenico Veneziano by Andrea del Castagno, but in reality Castagno actually died first. Vasari also damaged the reputation of some of his competitors, such as Jacopo da Pontormo, whom he portrayed as a paranoid recluse.</p><p>Vasari is also hilariously biased in favor of Florence: &quot;in the practice of these rare exercises and arts—namely, in painting, in sculpture, and in architecture—the Tuscan intellects have always been exalted and raised high above all others&quot;. The story of his visit to Titian (a Venetian) is typical:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>One day as Michelangelo and Vasari were going to see Titian in the Belvedere, they saw in a painting he had just completed a naked woman representing Danae with Jupiter transformed into a golden shower on her lap, and, as is done in the artisan&#39;s presence, they gave it high praise. After leaving Titian, and discussing his method, Buonarroti strongly commended him, declaring that he liked his colouring and style very much but that it was a pity artisans in Venice did not learn to draw well from the beginning and that Venetian painters did not have a better method of study.</p></div></blockquote><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Titian_-_Danae_%28Hermitage_Version%29.jpg" width="565" height="359" title="Titian Danae" alt="Titian, Danae with Jupiter as a &quot;golden shower&quot;"><span class="image-caption">Titian, Danae with Jupiter as a &quot;golden shower&quot;</span><p>I read (as usual) the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Painters-Sculptors-Architects-Everymans-Library/dp/0679451013?dchild=1&keywords=vasari+everyman&qid=1631491236&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=215f498a7fc651d15b2a9cad6eae5e25&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Everyman edition</a>, but would not recommend braving the entire work unless you&#39;re a Renaissance art fanatic.

Petrarch (1304-1374) invented the idea of the dark ages in order to explain the deficiencies of his own time relative to the ancients, and dreamt of a better future:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>My fate is to live among varied and confusing storms. But for you perhaps, if as I hope and wish you will live long after me, there will follow a better age. This sleep of forgetfulness will not last forever. When the darkness has been dispersed, our descendants can come again in the former pure radiance.</p></div></blockquote><p>To this scheme of ancient glory and medieval darkness, Vasari added a third—modern—age and gave it a name: <em>rinascita</em>.<span class="tooltip"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/09/17/book-review-the-lives-of-the-most-excellent-painters-sculptors-and-architects/#fn15039362642" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref15039362642">2</sup></a></span> And within his <em>rinascita</em>, Vasari described an upward trajectory starting with Cimabue, and ending in a golden age beginning with eccentric Leonardo and crazed sex maniac Raphael, only to give way to the perfect Michelangelo in the end. It is a trajectory driven by the modern conception of the artist as an individual <em>auteur</em>, rather than a faceless craftsman.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>The most benign Ruler of Heaven in His clemency turned His eyes to the earth, and, having perceived the infinite vanity of all those labours, the ardent studies without any fruit, and the presumptuous self-sufficiency of men, which is even further removed from truth than is darkness from light, and desiring to deliver us from such great errors, became minded to send down to earth a spirit with universal ability in every art and every profession.</p></div></blockquote><p>This golden age was certainly no utopia, as 16th century Italy was ravaged by political turbulence, frequent plague, and incessant war. Many of the artists mentioned were at some point taken hostage by invading armies; Vasari himself had to rescue a part of Michelangelo&#39;s David when it was broken off in the battle to expel the Medici from Florence.</p><p>And yet Vasari saw greatness in his time, and the entire book is structured around a narrative of artistic progress. He documented the spread of new technologies and techniques (such as the spread of oil painting, imported from the Low Countries), which—as an artist—he had an intimate understanding of.</p><p>This story of progress is paralleled with the rediscovery (and, ultimately, surpassing) of the ancients. It would take until the 17th century for the <em>querelle des Anciens et des Modernes</em> to really take off in France, but in Florence Vasari had already seen enough to decide the question in favor of his contemporaries—the essence of the Enlightenment is already present in 1550. He writes about Donatello (1386-1466), who produced the first nude male sculpture of the modern era:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>The talent of Donato was such, and he was so admirable in all his actions, that he may be said to have been one of the first to give light, by his practice, judgment, and knowledge, to the art of sculpture and of good design among the moderns; and he deserves all the more commendation, because in his day, apart from the columns, sarcophagi, and triumphal arches, there were no antiquities revealed above the earth. And it was through him, chiefly, that there arose in Cosimo de&#39; Medici the desire to introduce into Florence the antiquities that were and are in the house of the Medici; all of which he restored with his own hand.</p></div></blockquote><p>Similarly, he explains that Mino da Fiesole&#39;s (1429-1484) work was &quot;somewhat stiff&quot;, yet it was nonetheless admired because &quot;few antiquities had been discovered up to that time&quot;. The ancients created a new higher standard, which first created a thirst for imitation, then an impetus to outclass it.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>...their successors were enabled to attain to it through seeing excavated out of the earth certain antiquities cited by Pliny as amongst the most famous, such as the Laocoon, the Hercules, the Great Torso of the Belvedere, and likewise the Venus, the Cleopatra, the Apollo, and an endless number of others, which, both with their sweetness and their severity, with their fleshy roundness copied from the greatest beauties of nature, and with certain attitudes which involve no distortion of the whole figure but only a movement of certain parts, and are revealed with a most perfect grace, brought about the disappearance of a certain dryness, hardness, and sharpness of manner...</p></div></blockquote><p>It is curious that this competitive attitude seems to have disappeared in later eras. In the 18th century, for example, the English painter Joshua Reynolds said of the Belvedere Torso that it retained &quot;the traces of superlative genius…on which succeeding ages can only gaze with inadequate admiration.&quot; The Italians of the Renaissance had such a civilizational confidence and such an individual lust for Glory that these fatalistic thoughts would never enter their minds. Take Raphael&#39;s <em>School of Athens</em> for example: imagine the self-confidence (if not presumption) necessary to paint Plato (portrayed by da Vinci) and Heraclitus (portrayed by Michelangelo) in the form of your friends and contemporaries! Imagine someone trying that today—Dennet as Plato, Gaspar Noé as...Diogenes?</p><p>What came first, the excellence or the confidence? Who can disentangle cause and effect? Braudel suggests an initial &quot;restlessness&quot; created the necessary conditions:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Perhaps if the door is to be opened to innovation, the source of all progress, there must be first some restlessness which may express itself in such trifles as dress, the shape of shoes and hairstyles?</p></div></blockquote><p>Vasari certainly thought this ambition was a necessary ingredient for greatness. Commenting on Andrea del Sarto, he writes that he was excellent in all skills but &quot;a certain timidity of spirit and a sort of humility and simplicity in his nature made it impossible that there should be seen in him that glowing ardour and that boldness which, added to his other qualities, would have made him truly divine in painting&quot;.</p><p>And one may ask: why is there no ancient Vasari? Pliny, describing the Laocoön, writes that it is &quot;a work to be preferred to all that the arts of painting and sculpture have produced&quot;. Yet he is content to simply mention the names of the artists in passing: Agesander, Athenodorus, and Polydorus of Rhodes. There is not the slightest hint of curiosity about the lives of those most excellent men. Even worse, they were (highly-skilled) copyists, selling reproductions of Hellenistic works to wealthy Romans. The name of the original sculptor is lost to time.<span class="tooltip"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/09/17/book-review-the-lives-of-the-most-excellent-painters-sculptors-and-architects/#fn15039362643" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref15039362643">3</sup></a></span></p><h2 id="Aesthetic-Value-Over-Time"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/09/17/book-review-the-lives-of-the-most-excellent-painters-sculptors-and-architects/#Aesthetic-Value-Over-Time" class="headerlink" title="Aesthetic Value Over Time"></a>Aesthetic Value Over Time</h2><p>You&#39;re probably familiar with the story of the Mona Lisa: it was unpopular until it was stolen in 1911, Apollinaire and Picasso were suspects in the case, and when it was finally returned two years later it had become the most famous painting in the world. I was surprised, then, to see that the Mona Lisa was singled out for effusive praise by Vasari. He even focuses on that famous smile:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>For Francesco del Giocondo, Leonardo undertook the portrait of Mona Lisa, his wife, and after working on it for four years, he left the work unfinished, and it may be found at Fontainebleau today in the possession of King Francis. Anyone wishing to see the degree to which art can imitate Nature can easily understand this from the head, for here Leonardo reproduced all the details that can be painted with subtlety. The eyes have the lustre and moisture always seen in living people, while around them are the lashes and all the reddish tones which cannot be produced without the greatest care. The eyebrows could not be more natural, for they represent the way the hair grows in the skin—thicker in some places and thinner in others, following the pores of the skin. The nose seems lifelike with its beautiful pink and tender nostrils. The mouth, with its opening joining the red of the lips to the flesh of the face, seemed to be real flesh rather than paint. Anyone who looked very attentively at the hollow of her throat would see her pulse beating: to tell the truth, it can be said that portrait was painted in a way that would cause every brave artist to tremble and fear, whoever he might be. Since Mona Lisa was very beautiful, Leonardo employed this technique: while he was painting her portrait, he had musicians who played or sang and clowns who would always make her merry in order to drive away her melancholy, which painting often brings to portraits. And in this portrait by Leonardo, there is a smile so pleasing that it seems more divine than human, and it was considered a wondrous thing that it was as lively as the smile of the living original.</p></div></blockquote><p>There are, however, one or two minor problems with his account. One of them is that Vasari never actually saw the Mona Lisa: he was about 6 years old when the painting was moved to France, and he never left Italy. Vasari also says that Leonardo left the painting unfinished, while the Mona Lisa is very much finished. So what&#39;s going on? Until the 20th century people simply thought he made it up based on sketches or second-hand accounts.</p><p>And then, in 1913, an art collector discovered a <em>second Mona Lisa</em> hanging in a house in Somerset. By all accounts it appears to be authentic, and it matches a sketch by Raphael. It&#39;s also a better match for Vasari&#39;s description, though he may not have seen this one either. If he thought this one was great, just imagine how he would have raved about the <em>first</em> Mona Lisa!</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Isleworthml.JPG/1567px-Isleworthml.JPG" width="565" height="738" title="The Second Mona Lisa" alt="The Second Mona Lisa"><span class="image-caption">The Second Mona Lisa</span><p>This raises the question: do we venerate the same paintings as Vasari due to path dependency, or due to constancy in aesthetic judgment? Broadly, Vasari&#39;s taste is our own. He likes Raphael, da Vinci, and Michelangelo above all others. There are certainly those who argue that the influence and worship of Florentine artists is merely a historical accident, and if Vasari had been a Venetian the history of painting would have turned out rather different.</p><p>There are a few interesting points of difference. For example, Botticelli only gets a very short biography, and his <em>Birth of Venus</em> merits not more more than a passing comment: Vasari says &quot;he expressed himself with grace&quot;. Another artist who was mostly ignored by Vasari and was later &quot;reevaluated&quot; is the highly erotic Antonio da Correggio.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Antonio_Allegri%2C_called_Correggio_-_Jupiter_and_Io_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/884px-Antonio_Allegri%2C_called_Correggio_-_Jupiter_and_Io_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg" width="565" height="1309" title="Jupiter and Io" alt="Correggio, Jupiter and Io"><span class="image-caption">Correggio, Jupiter and Io</span><h2 id="Architecture"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/09/17/book-review-the-lives-of-the-most-excellent-painters-sculptors-and-architects/#Architecture" class="headerlink" title="Architecture?"></a>Architecture?</h2><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>YOU - Hold on, is architecture also art?</p><p>CONCEPTUALIZATION - Of course not, it&#39;s autism. Box-drawing. Masturbation with a ruler and a sextant or whatever they use.</p></div></blockquote><p>Painters, <em>naturally</em>. Sculptors, <em>of course</em>. But...architects? Certainly no twenty-first century chronicler would collect the lives of painters, sculptors, and <em>architects</em>. In our own age architecture is little more than an exercise in applied misanthropy. It has gotten so bad <a href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/2017/10/why-you-hate-contemporary-architecture" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even the commies</a> can tell it sucks, and they&#39;re not exactly famous for their aesthetic discernment. And these Renaissance artists were not limited to constructing fancy villas or churches, they often got involved in military engineering as well!</p><p>Architects might try to defend themselves by appealing to specialization and saying that, as the science has progressed, an architect today requires far more specialized knowledge than they did in the 16th century. One cannot be both a painter and an architect at the same time. Yet I cannot help but notice that the Duomo and the Uffizi are still beautiful and still standing, while our contemporary concrete claptrap starts crumbling after a couple of years. Our segregation of these fields is both arbitrary and misguided. Perhaps education (and the way it commoditizes knowledge) is to blame.<span class="tooltip"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/09/17/book-review-the-lives-of-the-most-excellent-painters-sculptors-and-architects/#fn15039362644" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref15039362644">4</sup></a></span></p><h2 id="Human-Capital-Power-Laws-and-Cluster-Effects"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/09/17/book-review-the-lives-of-the-most-excellent-painters-sculptors-and-architects/#Human-Capital-Power-Laws-and-Cluster-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Human Capital, Power Laws, and Cluster Effects"></a>Human Capital, Power Laws, and Cluster Effects</h2><p>Perhaps the reason these people were able to paint, sculpt, architect, and sometimes even do a bit of military engineering on the side, is that art was one of very few avenues available at the time for people to monetize their high human capital. A smart guy in 16th century Florence had limited options: he might go into law, try to be a scribe, or (if he had money) commerce. Science was not a profession, and there were no hedge funds or startups. Art offered a new avenue, open to all with talent.<span class="tooltip"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/09/17/book-review-the-lives-of-the-most-excellent-painters-sculptors-and-architects/#fn15039362645" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref15039362645">5</sup></a></span></p><p>Art was also something of a winner-take-all market, with virtually unlimited upside for the select few who could make it to the top. Like modern athletes, the superstars were drowning in money while the average painter didn&#39;t make all that much. Time seems to have confirmed this power law in artistic excellence: nobody goes to a museum for the paintings of Bartolomeo Vivarini, while da Vinci draws millions every year.</p><p>Societies are broadly defined by how they allocate status and (by extension) how they allocate the scarce biological resources they have access to. Rome rewarded military leadership, so it got a lot of great generals (and civil wars). The kleptocrats of Renaissance Italy allocated talent to art; gold and fame attracted competence. At the time Vasari was writing, there were about thirty thousand men in Florence—roughly the same as the number of male citizens in Classical Athens, and also roughly the same as today&#39;s population of Dubuque, Iowa. Yet their achievements (to borrow a phrase from Gibbon) would excuse the computation of imaginary millions.</p><p>One might ask: where are all the Shakespeares? There are about 25x more literate men in England today than in 1564, how come we aren&#39;t producing 25x more Shakespeares? The answer is that our society does not allocate much of its human capital to playwriting. There are (potentially) great authors who spend 8 hours a day writing ads for cereal, or improving trading algorithms by 0.01%. Capitalism, for all its virtues, tends to instill a preference for <em>mere optimization</em> in its subjects; the shadow of utility blots out the impetus for Glory.</p><p>One of the starkest lessons from Vasari is the importance of clusters in artistic production. He highlights both the spur of competition and the virtues of learning through imitation. He documents how new techniques (oil, perspective, new approaches to color) spread like wildfire, and how the newly unearthed Roman statues provided both a lesson and a stimulus for improvement. The mentor-mentee relationship was extremely important; a young artist could destroy his entire career by choosing the wrong master.</p><p>There is an extensive literature in &quot;economics&quot;<span class="tooltip"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/09/17/book-review-the-lives-of-the-most-excellent-painters-sculptors-and-architects/#fn15039362646" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref15039362646">6</sup></a></span> covering the influence of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S016604621830423X" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agglomeration in creative industries</a>. Hollywood is an obvious example, but there also seem to be agglomeration gains in <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.675.8602&rep=rep1&type=pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">18-19th century classical music</a>, while a writer who moved to London in the 18th or 19th century ended up with <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0094119019300415" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12% higher productivity</a>. Renaissance Florence certainly seems to be another one of these (which suggests an element of path dependency).</p><p>A century ago a man like Ernest Hemingway could just travel to Paris, join a flourishing artistic community, and have lunch with the world&#39;s greatest author (James Joyce). Imagine some random guy flying to New York and trying to have a meal with Thomas Pynchon today. Global connectivity has made us more insular by removing the barriers that used to act as filters. The apprenticeship opportunities of the Renaissance do not exist any more, though the <a href="https://www.mercatus.org/emergent-ventures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wealthy patrons</a> are still around.</p><p>Yet new possibilities for cluster formation open up on the internet: group chats, forums, perhaps even twitter. But it is not easy to cultivate the right mix of competition and imitation, or the preconditions necessary for cultural confidence and a lust for Glory. Perhaps the closest analogy in our time would be Silicon Valley; a relatively small area which attracts talent in search of money and fame. It certainly has that culture of ambition.</p><p>I leave you with a final quotation from Vasari, on the motivations behind art and how they affect the ultimate product:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>And, to tell the truth of the matter, those craftsmen who have as their ultimate and principal end gain and profit, and not honour and glory, rarely become very excellent, even although they may have good and beautiful genius; besides which, labouring for a livelihood, as very many do who are weighed down by poverty and their families, and working not by inclination, when the mind and the will are drawn to it, but by necessity from morning till night, is a life not for men who have honour and glory as their aim, but for hacks, as they are called, and manual labourers, for the reason that good works do not get done without first having been well considered for a long time. And it was on that account that Rustici used to say in his more mature years that you must first think, then make your sketches, and after that your designs; which done, you must put them aside for weeks and even months without looking at them, and then, choosing the best, put them into execution; but that method cannot be followed by everyone, nor do those use it who labour only for gain.</p></div></blockquote><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Giorgio_Vasari_Selbstportr%C3%A4t.jpg" title="Giorgio Vasari" alt="Giorgio Vasari, Self-portrait"><span class="image-caption">Giorgio Vasari, Self-portrait</span><div id="footnotes"><hr><div id="footnotelist"><ol style="list-style:none;padding-left:0;margin-left:40px"><li id="fn15039362641"><span style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;padding-right:10px;margin-left:-40px">1.</span><span><span class="footnote-contents">&quot;And without Giorgio Vasari of Arezzo and his all-important work, we should perhaps to this day have no history of northern art, or of the art of modern Europe, at all.&quot;</span><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/09/17/book-review-the-lives-of-the-most-excellent-painters-sculptors-and-architects/#fnref15039362641" rev="footnote"> ↩</a></span></li><li id="fn15039362642"><span style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;padding-right:10px;margin-left:-40px">2.</span><span><span class="footnote-contents">The word &quot;renaissance&quot; was only popularized in the 19th century by Michelet.</span><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/09/17/book-review-the-lives-of-the-most-excellent-painters-sculptors-and-architects/#fnref15039362642" rev="footnote"> ↩</a></span></li><li id="fn15039362643"><span style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;padding-right:10px;margin-left:-40px">3.</span><span><span class="footnote-contents">There was a sculptor-biographer named Xenokrates of Sicyon but all his works are lost.</span><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/09/17/book-review-the-lives-of-the-most-excellent-painters-sculptors-and-architects/#fnref15039362643" rev="footnote"> ↩</a></span></li><li id="fn15039362644"><span style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;padding-right:10px;margin-left:-40px">4.</span><span><span class="footnote-contents">McKenzie Wark: &quot;Education “disciplines” knowledge, segregating it into homogenous “fields,” presided over by suitably “qualified” guardians charged with policing its representations.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The idea of a personal &quot;carbon footprint&quot; is an <a href="https://mashable.com/feature/carbon-footprint-pr-campaign-sham/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">oil company psyop</a>. About 20 years ago, British Petroleum launched an ad campaign popularizing the notion and put out a website letting you calculate your &quot;carbon footprint&quot;. They&#39;re <a href="https://www.knowyourcarbonfootprint.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still at it</a>.</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/ibs_carbon_footprint.png"><p>It&#39;s an idea with remarkable memetic power, both for individuals and brands. Displaying your concern about your personal carbon footprint lets you show off your prosociality and marks you out as someone virtuous, someone who takes personal responsibility. The idea also feeds into people&#39;s narcissistic tendencies, reassuring them that they&#39;re actually important and that their actions matter in the world.</p><p>Marketers love the concept, and any company trying to appeal to the nature-loving demographic can use and abuse it: <a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/outdoor-brands-get-serious-about-carbon-footprint-adventure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Outdoor Brands Get Serious About the Carbon Footprint of Adventure: The North Face and Protect Our Winters unveil an activism-oriented CO2 calculator</a>.</p><p>The problem with all of this, and the reason BP pushed the idea in the first place, is that your personal carbon footprint doesn&#39;t matter. You&#39;re 1 of about 7.6 billion people on earth, so your effect is about 1/7,600,000,000 ≈ 0.000000013%. Your personal carbon footprint is completely irrelevant to climate change. Global warming is a collective issue that requires collective solutions; framing it as a problem that <em>individuals</em> can tackle (and that individuals are responsible for) distracts from the <em>public</em> policy changes that are necessary. Environmentalist signaling is complete nonsense but also deadly serious.</p><h2 id="The-Parallel"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/08/31/against-caring-about-individual-bad-studies/#The-Parallel" class="headerlink" title="The Parallel"></a>The Parallel</h2><p>Caring about individual bad studies is a bit like caring about your individual carbon footprint.</p><p>People occasionally send me shitty papers, and year or two ago I would care a lot, enjoying the shameful thrill of getting Mad Online about some fraud, or having fun picking apart yet another terrible study. It&#39;s an attractive activity, and performing it in public shows how much you care about Good Science. Picking out a single paper to replicate operates at the same level. What&#39;s the impact of all this?</p><p>In the idealized version of science, a replication failure would raise serious doubts about the veracity of the original study and have all sorts of downstream effects. In the real version of social science, none of that matters. You have to go on active memetic warfare if you want to have any effect, and even then there&#39;s no guarantee you&#39;ll succeed. As Tal Yarkoni puts it, &quot;<a href="https://twitter.com/talyarkoni/status/1427972323068583943" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the dominant response is some tut-tutting and mild expression of indignation, and then everything reverts to status quo until the next case</a>&quot;. People <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20136577/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keep citing retracted articles</a>. Brian fucking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Wansink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wansink</a> has been getting over 7 citations <em>per day</em> in 2021. So what exactly do you think a replication is going to achieve?</p><p><strong>Walker</strong></p><p>A couple years ago Alexey Guzey wrote &quot;<a href="https://guzey.com/books/why-we-sleep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew Walker&#39;s &quot;Why We Sleep&quot; Is Riddled with Scientific and Factual Errors</a>&quot;, finding not only errors but even egregious data manipulation in Walker&#39;s book. Guzey later collaborated with Andrew Gelman on <a href="https://www.gwern.net/docs/statistics/bias/2020-gelman.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Statistics as Squid Ink: How Prominent Researchers Can Get Away with Misrepresenting Data</a>.</p><p>What was the effect of all this? Nothing.</p><p>Guzey <a href="https://twitter.com/alexeyguzey/status/1426273130138546179" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explains on twitter</a>:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>my piece on the book has gotten &gt;250k views by now and still not a single neuroscientist or sleep scientist commented meaningfully on the merits of my accusations. [...] According to UC Berkeley, &quot;there were some minor errors in the book, which Walker intends to correct&quot;. The case is closed.</p><p>The feedback loops that are supposed to reward people who seek truth and to punish charlatans are just completely broken.</p></div></blockquote><p>...but a prominent neuroscientist did write to him in private to express his agreement.</p><p><strong>Implicit Bias</strong></p><p>It is <em>so</em> much harder to get rid of bullshit than it is to prevent its publication in the first place. Let&#39;s take a look at some of the literature on implicit bias.</p><p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23773046/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oswald et al (2013)</a> meta-analyze the relation between the IAT and discrimination: &quot;IATs were poor predictors of every criterion category other than brain activity, and the IATs performed no better than simple explicit measures.&quot; <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/sjop.12288" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carlsson &amp; Agerström (2016)</a> refine the Oswald et al paper, and find that &quot;the overall effect was close to zero and highly inconsistent across studies [...] little evidence that the IAT can meaningfully predict discrimination&quot;.</p><p><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02483/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meissner et al (2019)</a> review the IAT literature and find that the &quot;predictive value for behavioral criteria is weak and their incremental validity over and above self-report measures is negligible&quot;.</p><p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31192631/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forscher et al (2019)</a> meta-analyze the effect of procedures to change implicit measures, and find that the &quot;generally produced trivial changes in behavior [...] changes in implicit measures did not mediate changes in explicit measures or behavior&quot;. Figure 8 from their paper shows the effect of changing implicit measures on actual behavior:</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/ibs_iatchangeeffect.png"><p>What was the effect of all this? Nothing.</p><p>Just within the last few days, the New Jersey Supreme Court announced <a href="https://www.nj.com/news/2021/08/njs-top-court-acknowledges-racism-bias-in-criminal-justice-system-heres-its-plan-to-change-it.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">implicit bias training for all employees of state courts</a>, &quot;Dean Health Plan in Wisconsin implemented new strategies to address health equity in maternal health, <a href="https://healthpayerintelligence.com/news/achp-health-equity-success-requires-holistic-integrated-approach" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including implicit bias training for employees</a>&quot;, the Auburn Human Rights Commission has &quot;<a href="https://auburnpub.com/lifestyles/auburn-human-rights-commission-continues-work-on-implicit-bias/article_b919798b-3204-59db-8f86-f9993e0ed04a.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offered implicit bias training to supervisory personnel in Auburn city government, the Cayuga County Sheriff&#39;s Office, public schools and other local organizations</a>&quot;, and California&#39;s Attorney General is making sure that healthcare facilities are complying with a law <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-ensures-california-perinatal-healthcare-facilities-are" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requiring anti-implicit bias training</a>.</p><p>You can debunk, and (fail to) replicate all you want, but it don&#39;t mean a thing. <a href="http://www.umass.edu/preferen/You%20Must%20Read%20This/Mitchell-Tetlock2018.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mitchell &amp; Tetlock (2017)</a> write:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>once employers, health care providers, police forces, and policy-makers seek to develop real solutions to real problems and then monitor the costs and benefits of these proposed solutions, the shortcomings of implicit prejudice research will likely become apparent</p></div></blockquote><p>But it didn&#39;t turn out that way, did it? Just as with the personal carbon footprint, the ultimate outcome is a secondary consideration at best.</p><h2 id="Fin"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/08/31/against-caring-about-individual-bad-studies/#Fin" class="headerlink" title="Fin"></a>Fin</h2><p>Yarkoni (the British Petroleum of social science) says &quot;<a href="https://www.talyarkoni.org/blog/2018/10/02/no-its-not-the-incentives-its-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it&#39;s not the incentives, it&#39;s you</a>&quot; but, <em>really</em>, it&#39;s the incentives. Before you can run, you must walk. Before you replicate, you must have a scientific ecosystem with reliable self-correction mechanisms.<span class="tooltip"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/08/31/against-caring-about-individual-bad-studies/#fn14384164271" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref14384164271">1</sup></a></span> And before you build that, it&#39;s a good idea to limit the publication of false positives and low-quality research in general.</p><p>One of the key insights of longtermism is that if humanity survives in the long term, the <em>vast</em> majority of humans will live in the future, so even a small improvement to their welfare can have a huge effect. We might make a similar argument about longtermism in social science: the vast majority of papers lie in the future. If we can do something today to improve them even by a little bit, the cumulative impact would be enormous. On the other hand, defeating one of the 10,000 bad papers that will be published this year is not going to do much at all. Effective scientific altruism is systematically improving the future by 0.01% rather than putting your energy into deboonking a single study. Every dollar wasted on replication is a dollar that could&#39;ve been invested in fixing the underlying collective problems instead. The past is not going to change, but the future is still malleable.</p><p>Ideally we&#39;d proclaim the beginning of a new era, ban citations to any pre-2022 works, and start from scratch (except actually do things properly this time). Realistically that won&#39;t happen, so the second-best approach is probably a Hirschmanian <em>Exit</em> into <a href="https://newscience.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">parallel institutions</a>.</p><div id="footnotes"><hr><div id="footnotelist"><ol style="list-style:none;padding-left:0;margin-left:40px"><li id="fn14384164271"><span style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;padding-right:10px;margin-left:-40px">1.</span><span><span class="footnote-contents">I don't want to overstate the case here—some disciplines work pretty well, so it's not entirely hopeless.

Vasari was a painter and architect who lived in the first half of the 16th century and personally knew many of the greats (including Michelangelo). In this gossipy collection of biographies he covers more than 180 artists, starting with Cimabue and Giotto in the 13thC and ending with Michelangelo and others who were still alive at the time of writing (like Titian and Jacopo Sansovino). The ideas of progress and renaissance are front and center: the great ancients, the decline in the middle ages, and finally the triumphant rebirth of art in his own era. Parts of it are excellent, but it can get a bit dry and repetitive when he describes various minor artists, so I probably wouldn&#39;t recommend the full 2000+ page unabridged version.

Also draws on many questionable historical examples (for example he repeatedly uses the Thugs to illustrate his points).</li></ul><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Impro-Improvisation-Theatre-Keith-Johnstone/dp/0878301178?dchild=1&keywords=Impro%3A+Improvisation+and+the+Theatre&qid=1623102660&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=9860c585fae205470e179b11773d73d9&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Impro: Improvisation and the Theatre</a></strong> by Keith Johnstone. The general observations on status, presentation, space, etc. are quite good, but when he gets into the specifics about theater and masks it&#39;s rather dull and fluffy. Would have preferred something a bit more solid.</li></ul><h3 id="Fiction"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/07/01/links-and-what-ive-been-reading-q2-2021/#Fiction" class="headerlink" title="Fiction"></a>Fiction</h3><ul><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Uzumaki-3-1-Deluxe-vols/dp/1421561328?dchild=1&keywords=uzumaki&qid=1624218956&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=cb1bf08f1a1bf94a69e9676ab30c7499&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Uzumaki</a></strong> by Junji Ito. Horror manga. Starts with a simple idea: spirals are kinda creepy. From there it spins out in every direction, finally ending up in a bizarre post-apocalyptic Lovecraftian scenario. A virtuosic display of variations on a visual theme. Fantastic art, fantastically weird. Highly recommended. Lots of crazy body horror, not for the squeamish.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sailor-Who-Fell-Grace-Sea/dp/0679750150?dchild=1&keywords=The+Sailor+Who+Fell+from+Grace+with+the+Sea&qid=1625061961&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=f348081ed0ff1e132ca9a80a5febe27e&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea</a></strong> by Yukio Mishima. A great short novel about the sea, glory, death, and wanting to have sex with your mother. Somewhat autobiographical, in a symbolic way. Nihilism, tradition vs westernization, youth vs age, all in a lyrical and nautical style.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mao-II-Novel-Don-DeLillo/dp/0140152741?dchild=1&keywords=mao+ii&qid=1623099966&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=4d6a12a1f09ae167a6f2a2cc044d33f1&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mao II</a></strong> by Don DeLillo. Cults, mass media, a reclusive author. Love the style, very impressionistic. Lots of great sentences and great paragraphs, unfortunately they do not combine to form a Great Novel, the ideas never coalesce into anything solid. DeLillo revisits many of his typical themes here: American foreign policy, terrorism, cults, etc. Rather presciently written in 1991, very pessimistic on the potentials of mass action. &quot;The future belongs to crowds.&quot;</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Libra-Contemporary-American-Fiction-DeLillo/dp/0140156046?dchild=1&keywords=libra+delillo&qid=1623099945&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=e60f828242f3b72add0362f51da7bf3a&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Libra</a></strong> by Don DeLillo. A semi-fictionalized biography of Lee Harvey Oswald, based on the CIA/Cuban exiles conspiracy theory of the JFK assassination. Somewhat conventional in its style, and Pynchonesque in its attitude: conspiracies, axes of control and influence, strange coincidences, overeager pattern-matching, taking liberties with history. It&#39;s lacking the humor though. There&#39;s also a kind of meta parallel story of an FBI agent trying to piece together all the evidence, meticulously going through even the tiniest element (much like DeLillo). Pretty good, but <em>The Names</em> remains my favorite DeLillo.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pussy-Delicious-Tacos/dp/1534647511?dchild=1&keywords=The+Pussy&qid=1623100083&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=0fbad1a099d64e184ec47fec40811754&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Pussy</a></strong> by Delicious Tacos. A collection of autobiographical vignettes about sex and relationships. Starts out extremely vulgar and extremely funny, ends up in deep ugliness and despair. A tragedy disguised as a comedy. Pure blackpill fuel: a dystopian vision of work, love, aging, and human connection in our society. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4007163263?book_show_action=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slightly longer review</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Three-Novels-Molloy-Malone-Unnamable/dp/0802144470?dchild=1&keywords=the+unnamable&qid=1624229542&rnid=2941120011&s=books&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=3a14aad76569b17fc801e7c64a6d24e3&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Unnamable</a></strong> by Samuel Beckett. If you&#39;re interested in the extremes of experimental literature, this is a book for you. The novel at its most abstract and formless. Virtually no characters, plot, movement, imagery, dialogue, paragraphs, or really anything else you might normally associate with a novel. I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s a pleasurable read, but it&#39;s an interesting one at least. Isolation, existential loneliness, death.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Samuel-Beckett/dp/0802150667?keywords=beckett+how+it+is&qid=1624229564&s=books&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=bb5c9b918bb4d8f5ea8b219ebbf29ba5&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How It Is</a></strong> by Samuel Beckett. It can&#39;t possibly be sparser and more formless than <em>The Unnamable</em>, you think. But it is! Beckett does away even with coherent, full sentences in this one. Nothing but a series of roughly sketched impressions, in a halting and disjointed language. Not really my jam.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wasteland-Flint-Time-Sixth-Book-ebook/dp/B000FA66V2?dchild=1&keywords=wasteland+of+flint&qid=1623099892&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=9346f0e6661bfa5a32081790bdcad3d4&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wasteland of Flint</a></strong> by Thomas Harlan. A fun space opera in a unique setting (an Aztec-Japanese space empire), focused on xenoarchaeology. Ancient aliens, some cool <em>Solaris</em>-like ideas, some really out-there imagery. Unfortunately it&#39;s mostly sequelbait and the sequels don&#39;t seem to be very good.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Too-Like-Lightning-Terra-Ignota/dp/0765378019?dchild=1&keywords=too+like+the+lightning&qid=1623100152&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=19214d94a8c60b0f6b6195c2a5c0b70c&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Too Like the Lightning</a></strong> by Ada Palmer (dropped it half-way through). Wat. My reaction to this book is just pure bewilderment. I love Ada Palmer&#39;s blog, but wtf is going on here? Am I supposed to be laughing at the terrible narrator and his horrifically bad similes? Is it for children? The magical boy protagonist and philosophy 101 stuff certainly seems to indicate so. Or maybe &quot;young adults&quot;? What&#39;s with the nonsensical worldbuilding (an SF/fantasy future that worships 18th century philosophers, with absurd coincidences piled on top of each other)? And apparently none of the plot is resolved by the end of the book! The whole thing reminded me of the &quot;taxation of trade routes&quot; stuff from the prequels, and this image kept popping into my head:</p><img src="https://czabe.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/mr_plinkett_pic.jpg"></li></ul>]]></content>
