Guilt, sex, violence. Pessimistic and really with no solutions, I think Nietzsche identifies many similar issues but with a more positive spin on things, he sees a potential to transcend these limitations. Also, often very silly psychoanalytical stuff being treated as if it&#39;s physics. Overall: dense, short, and interesting.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Figuring-Maria-Popova/dp/0525565426?crid=1EQO0P1HRPMVR&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.cSHDuiLdShivFHBolDhGWw.p9-M2HIm--x-xubEDNTTV39GuUBsxUn9BUafonZ-EGA&dib_tag=se&keywords=figuring+popova&qid=1743577820&sprefix=figuring+popo%2Caps%2C227&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=e6b03ebc6cf5d65b08558b0154af88cf&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Figuring, by Maria Popova</strong></a></p><p>An alluring mix of science, history, love, love letters, poetry, art in general...The book constantly jumps around from one thread to another, and it occasionally gets exhausting and feels a bit like Popova was desperate to show off her erudition, but overall it works. The start and end are weak, but when it&#39;s going it goes really well, especially the sections that really pull you into the 19th century atmosphere.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Correspondence-German-List-Paul-Celan/dp/0857426427?crid=670AU35HNGYQ&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.HUsMNCAwz5h8vy7jrEMsCfkf9CTnfssMe8JCvFiimso.tTansTtElocBxRLz0U-tKdHDobBoSFqyEzItvffSyoE&dib_tag=se&keywords=celan+correspondence&qid=1743529474&sprefix=celan+corresponden%2Caps%2C170&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=7434c46c4af6eda745cbb84ac8da8d38&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Correspondence, by Paul Celan and Ingrid Bachmann</strong></a></p><p>The mix of intellectual/literary/philosophical exploration, combined with raw emotion and processing it all through art and metaphor...and the intensity of it all. Using poetry to express things that are too difficult to say otherwise. On the other hand when they talk about their work it feels shallow, and where is the passion where is the desire? Constantly, they find it impossible to express themselves well, they misunderstand each other horribly, Celan is ridiculously over-sensitive. It&#39;s a strange relationship to understand, and in the end the relationship drowns in the ashes of the war and Celan kills himself. A lot of business talk about publishing here or there. Probably wouldn&#39;t recommend unless you&#39;re a Celan fanatic.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Letters-Vintage-International-Vladimir-Nabokov/dp/0307476588?crid=2MHKO61H3F1IH&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.xsGcluxMyiXFKDCDzWYNHlO7UbFVFPiccO-1mb0_jqxF59of_ZTFT0aCn_yzHY3V3TAOxxEAzIAjtVKWx_tKXv76DHPDniy6UgYYRWu7mRSgXmaOxI-88kos202_ls1mKPaQElTBBviRftVYLGtEQMckDH_oLQO5kWMv5ss2x4T3SM0pj20Alao1z2HlnwCxtxfbFs-O9mhiKVhjNEKTSRYzG1I-LZEwZ42UoMJ33h0.gW1M0RtYF0SasFJ6YBTZQCPO8hmGKir8H8uhG_xPg64&dib_tag=se&keywords=letters+to+vera&qid=1743529499&sprefix=letters+to+ver%2Caps%2C197&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=deddaaaf9774037bab16aaa52e2e3f01&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Letters to Vera, by Vladimir Nabokov</strong></a></p><p>The early letters are delightful, Nabokov is very playful in general, has a lightness to him, a childishness even. Likes to play silly language games. One time he puts a parenthesis in every sentence, another he writes &quot;fastbreak&quot; instead of breakfast. Just a million silly little games. &quot;Letterlet&quot;! Crosswords, codes. But the letters get less playful and more bureaucratic as time passes, just dull records of dinners, clothing, weather, activities. There&#39;s very little in terms of what Nabokov is reading, what he&#39;s thinking, how he is writing, etc. Sometimes he will launch into a gorgeous description that reminds you that you&#39;re reading one of the Greats, though. In the letters from the 70s the style changes completely as he&#39;s obviously writing to an audience (to posterity), but all the earlier ones are raw. Overall: some flashes of brilliance but kind of dull on average.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Virginia-Woolf-Vita-Sackville-West-Classics/dp/1784876720?crid=1VIPSWY4QSLX7&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.NEmC05USN0QG8MUkXPAYGKpovVVC2r8HG_s0UNzzhauTC2OvzMw43rDJKXzJk704lvFoBfYnc_WGJdlGqUYvnipOiyWEzJAWPfrcjKdmXbZI4FaI6uk3xA-5yOalbc9luGAZ4cze3D27Zo-uHrokqw.It_Oxb1vDi8Wb_EIpo5jr4mMUN5h-eMZ147hXOFyDug&dib_tag=se&keywords=Love+Letters%3A+Virginia+Woolf+and+Vita+Sackville-West&qid=1743529447&sprefix=love+letters+virginia+woolf+and+vita+sackville-west%2Caps%2C212&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=8f8d443e78050ab2cafa8a35d96f1387&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Love Letters: Virginia Woolf and Vita Sackville-West</strong></a></p><p>Now we&#39;re really getting somewhere. These two have a peculiar relationship: Vita loves Virginia&#39;s brain; Virginia loves Vita&#39;s legs. The letters are fantastic, often caustically teasing, often insecure, often very loving. The collection also includes diary entries and letters from Vita to her husband (there&#39;s a hilarious one where she reassures him that despite having slept with Woolf twice, there&#39;s really nothing going on). They&#39;re both pushing up against the limits of social restrictions at the time and you can really feel it through their correspondence. Very interesting to see the lead-up to what is perhaps the greatest love letter of all time, Orlando. Short and sweet, recommended.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Literate-Passion-Letters-Miller-1932-1953/dp/015652791X?crid=JMZK0Y5OJFUP&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.gZ5j2whqXlIHupXziAmBu9HL1vmp5W1-bLRQa7PQ4ZWPPJgr0bPvGF_agUhzQPR0HRRUs5WzQbMx8mAcTkYp-xnZuhx7VKMGuRRyditvzqeTjR3Yp_ksXmHgKYP4P3KwW39VvnSx2xoXHMBGWGJCHt8vXPA9iC2ocLrYSrgyFKHz5-DG9oNOp-j4yj51CFCKXYPbdsKmX51Y8Ze07pTMSY93CMJstNyqKT58njiO4Ag.ayAvo_j2RL8TQR_G4dBwx0zn08jzF7WNEJLA_KlM6sw&dib_tag=se&keywords=a+literate+passion&qid=1743529422&sprefix=a+literate+passio%2Caps%2C202&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=8b1e90aa8425cc3ddf704a385cf82d97&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>A Literate Passion: Letters of Anaïs Nin &amp; Henry Miller, 1932-1953</strong></a></p><p>Ah, this is the real stuff right here. Across decades, across continents, across marriages and affairs and children, they always keep going. They really pour their hearts out to each other, talk about their writing, literature, relationships, psychology, everything. They give each other so much. They are both fantastic writers and write great letters. Miller can be overwhelming when he&#39;s really spilling everything out. My favorite in the love letter series so far.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tropic-Cancer-Penguin-Modern-Classics/dp/0141399139?crid=1SVZ1CG52H7I6&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.-5ooL8-6Ekmwpfn1YaX8sY-7STvKpgmcFXFuTnRqDe5HfdqwMV0vKXMtzTMLOZPj0cCwy7Zfrwo4Law9ZZQ7IgN5h3BVqyYmF19ftE--Yqff1sMyR6F02KqbPhPp2tsxQytShGfUEEkcoDR-dJTgeZGHNaeaUesZSTi3xQkwiKFQ8wDB9BxXr8XkqYqOemabQOPVCDbbR3Yg9IbbJ96MuzrnoQKt2qJ3OA3QJBLmlYI.OVQjMbkmae_yZj6ZA5RrX9jq9oPtTpYnTEzdW_Wceg0&dib_tag=se&keywords=tropic+of+cancer&qid=1743529259&sprefix=tropic+of+cance%2Caps%2C186&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=8509bc074ae30192c56f1f938d406d93&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Tropic of Cancer, by Henry Miller</strong></a></p><p>Inspired by the letters, I picked up Tropic of Cancer...there&#39;s not much to say about a book with such a reputation, is there? I would totally understand if someone hates this book, but I loved it. It&#39;s a primal scream, Miller is just desperate to get all this life and ideas and word out of him, and in what spectacular fashion he does it!</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Deleted-World-Poems-Tomas-Transtromer-ebook/dp/B00OFJ1F7Y?crid=15W219BR9BCVT&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.-0tJe2kBNKlnuxTbnUb49O8QDHCYdnJVjWyy0j6qgBDGjHj071QN20LucGBJIEps.Ln6eQ4k9I0zdKTOTVhksqdJKvKBJrHNWtVIxv9bYC7M&dib_tag=se&keywords=transtromer+deleted+world&qid=1743529230&sprefix=transtromer+deleted+worl%2Caps%2C167&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=f96bb7d8175802f75c8152b30599512d&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>The Deleted World, by Tomas Transtromer</strong></a></p><p>These poems are just <em>so</em> Swedish. The dark forests, the ice, the cold, I felt like a moose might jump out of the book at any moment.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The fire crackles, sending embers spiraling into the dark. First come the hunters, their bodies marked with ochre and ash. They drag their feet through the dust, circling the flames, with reverence, with hunger. They feel the heat of the fire on their faces and the sting of smoke in their noses. Then bone strikes wood, the sound echoing from deep within the cave, and their bodies awaken, limbs twisting to the tempo of the drums. The beat quickens. Muscles tense and they charge ahead. Skin bright with sweat, circling the fire again and again, yelling in unison between the beats, sharp calls that cut the air, each cry landing like a strike, urging the rhythm forward. The old one raises a gnarled hand, and suddenly it stops. Then the women emerge, carved bones swinging from their necks. They stomp their feet, heads thrown back, spines arching, every movement honed and deliberate. <em>Shake. Stamp. Turn. Crouch. Leap.</em></p><p>Their shadows undulate in a wild procession across the cave wall, massive, distorted, sliding over the great charcoal buffalo. The beasts captured in the middle of a charge, great curved horns sweeping forward, every sinew etched with care. A man kneels in the corner, his fingers blackened with coal. He leans close, his nose almost touching the stone, his eyes narrowing. He cranes his head and studies the dancers, then turns around and traces their shapes below the great beasts. He&#39;s deepening the lines, smoothing the curves. His breath is steady, every stroke thoughtful and exacting. But something catches his eye and breaks his concentration.</p><p>A dancer with feathers in her hair breaks from the circle. Her feet strike the ground in the same spot, over and over, carving a shallow dent into the earth. Her arms swing in wide arcs, each movement mirroring the last. Drums quicken. Feet pound. The voices rise in chants that climb and fall with the flames, the fire blazing wild in their eyes, a hunger flickering from face to face. The rhythm doesn&#39;t stop, they dance until their bodies remember what their minds cannot explain. This is how they hold the hunt in their bones. This is how they honor what feeds them. This is how they become more than flesh, how they become one.</p><p>The cave breathes.</p><p>The fire dims and fades to black—</p><!-- A spotlight carves her out of the darkness; the violins surge, their aetherial notes climbing higher and higher; Anna Pavlova, weightless, rises onto the very tips of her toes, barely touching the floor at all. --><p>A spotlight carves Anna Pavlova out of the infinite darkness; the violins surge, their aetherial notes climbing higher and higher; weightless, she rises onto the very tips of her toes, barely touching the floor at all.</p><p><em>Spin.</em></p><p>Her arms form a perfect circle above her head, unwavering.</p><p><em>Spin.</em></p><p>Thirty-two fouettés, each one mathematically identical to the last.</p><p>Spin.</p><p>Her final revolution completes.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Three years ago, I was a 34-year-old who hadn&#39;t had sex in fifteen years. Since then I&#39;ve failed miserably at dating, then turned into a total manwhore, and eventually found someone really special to commit to. In my previous piece <a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/02/25/the-harem-of-an-autist/">&quot;The Harem of an Autist&quot;</a>, I shared the story of that journey. Some comments accused me of making it up, a bunch of others asked: &quot;How?&quot; This essay is the answer, the practical guide I wish someone had given me before I started.</p><h2 id="What-This-Is"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/03/20/how-to-be-good-at-dating/#What-This-Is" class="headerlink" title="What This Is"></a>What This Is</h2><p>Why should you listen to me? Because I&#39;m a fairly regular dude who attracts women without <a href="https://x.com/CartoonsHateHer/status/1876690846499696971" target="_blank" rel="noopener">any easy-mode levers like money or being a turbo-chad</a>. I&#39;m just a weird nerd who (after fifteen years of celibacy) decided to make dating his autistic special interest and discovered that it&#39;s actually not that difficult.</p><p>Before embarking on this experiment, I read a lot of dating content online and in books, and all the good advice can be boiled down to: self-improvement, self-respect, confidence, openness, honesty, and vulnerability. That all sounds a bit abstract though, so I&#39;m going to break it down into some more concrete advice.</p><p>Ultimately the central point is that it&#39;s a lot easier than you might think. Before I started dating, I had no idea it was even possible to meet a hot young woman who begs you to spit on her face on the first date. But eventually I realized it&#39;s completely trivial and practically accessible to almost anyone: you go on the apps, have a fun conversation in a bar for a couple of hours, and it just happens. If you take anything away from this essay, it should be that this is easily achievable for a normal person who actually puts some effort into dating.<span class="tooltip"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/03/20/how-to-be-good-at-dating/#fn16923123491" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref16923123491">1</sup></a></span> But you need to actually try. You need to intentionally and consciously improve yourself and your approach.</p><p>I recognize that much of this advice comes from my personal experience. Dating is highly individualized, and what worked for me will not necessarily work for everyone else. But I think the broad principles will apply to the vast majority of cases, and it&#39;s up to you to adapt them to your particular situation.</p><!--[FITS HERE? I ended up dating women between 20 and 34, with most in their mid-20s. When it came to more serious relationships, the sweet spot in terms of looks and compatibility ended up being late 20s/early 30s. (My filters went up to 40, but I never dated anyone older than me...the number of fit women in their late 30s on the apps is basically zero, anyone who takes care of themselves is already in a relationship at that point.)There are more hot 20 year olds that are into older men than there are hot 35 year olds. By an order of magnitude.]--><h2 id="Reality-Check-The-Modern-Dating-Landscape"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/03/20/how-to-be-good-at-dating/#Reality-Check-The-Modern-Dating-Landscape" class="headerlink" title="Reality Check: The Modern Dating Landscape"></a>Reality Check: The Modern Dating Landscape</h2><p>The first thing you must understand is that dating markets are ruthlessly efficient at matching people of equivalent SMV. It&#39;s nearly impossible to consistently date out of your league. There is a kind of beauty in the brutal clarity of this system: it does not allow for any delusions about your position in the world of dating.</p><p>It has been said that dating apps brought gay dating norms to straights, but I don&#39;t think people have internalized exactly what that means. The truth is that if you are even a little bit handsome, you can hit a 3-digit bodycount (with attractive women) in a few years, easily.</p><p>Dating apps are a numbers game and must be treated as such. Very roughly the ratios for me were 100 swipes → 1 match → 0.1 dates → 0.05 lays → 0.005 meaningful connections. This is basically a funnel that would make a B2B SaaS startup founder hang himself. You will be rejected again and again and again. Eventually you get desensitised, but still there&#39;s a sense that one ought to be filled with a feeling of abject horror. How can one continue to believe in the existence of a benevolent deity in the face of these ratios?</p><p>Consider the time you spend on dating apps as a tax you pay for the possibility of sex and/or love. Some people are in a higher tax bracket than others, and yes, it&#39;s absolutely unfair. But people like to complain without actually putting in any work. You need to actually commit to the process, which means setting aside at least an hour a day for swiping and chatting on the apps, and consciously optimizing both yourself and your profile to achieve your goals. You need to try trying.</p><p>The relationship between attractiveness and results on the apps is a power law. If you improve your appeal by 5%, you&#39;re not going to increase your matches by 5%, you will double them. The people far above you are doing <em>unimaginably</em> well. Orders of magnitude, baby. Think Timmy Chalamet <a href="https://x.com/skyferrori/status/1720842930154344534" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spreading chlamydia across the NYU campus like an STD crop plane</a>.</p><h2 id="Casual-vs-Serious"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/03/20/how-to-be-good-at-dating/#Casual-vs-Serious" class="headerlink" title="Casual vs Serious"></a>Casual vs Serious</h2><p>It doesn&#39;t matter, the fundamental principles are exactly the same: self-improvement, honesty, vulnerability, intentionality. The only thing that changes is what you explicitly state you&#39;re looking for.</p><p>However, even if your ultimate goal is a serious relationship, I strongly recommend that you start with casual dating. Not to stack bodies like some notch-counting sociopath, but because it&#39;s the only way to develop the skills, confidence, abundance mindset, and self-knowledge that serious relationships actually require. Serious dating without a hoe phase preceeding it is like trying to run a marathon without doing any training first. If you enter a relationship from a position of scarcity, insecurity, and desperation, of course things are going to be difficult. You need to figure out who you are and what you want before you can actually choose well. You will know when you&#39;re ready.</p><p>When I met my current partner, I instantly recognized something extraordinary precisely because I had enough data points to make that judgment. Without that contrast, without knowing what mediocre connections feel like firsthand, I&#39;d have no idea what &quot;exceptional&quot; even means. You need a baseline for comparison.</p><p>The only real difference between casual and serious dating is how you articulate your intentions. For casual: &quot;I&#39;m not looking for anything serious right now&quot;. For relationships: &quot;I&#39;m looking for a long-term partner&quot;. Either way, the honesty, the vulnerability, the self-respect remain identical.</p><h2 id="Practical-Fundamentals"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/03/20/how-to-be-good-at-dating/#Practical-Fundamentals" class="headerlink" title="Practical Fundamentals"></a>Practical Fundamentals</h2><h3 id="The-Handcuff-Rule"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/03/20/how-to-be-good-at-dating/#The-Handcuff-Rule" class="headerlink" title="The Handcuff Rule"></a>The Handcuff Rule</h3><p>In everything you do, you should never go for broad appeal; always target the niche you&#39;re actually after. You do that by being polarizing in the right way. Example: I was looking for kinky, adventurous, open-minded women, so I had a picture of a pair of leather handcuffs on my profile. That&#39;s a <em>really</em> strong filter! It almost certainly decreased the total number of matches I got, but the ones I did get were a much better fit. Whatever niche you are interested in, the important thing is to create filters that draw in the target audience and pushes away everyone else. Finding your niche in the dating market and adapting your approach to the needs of that ni is crucial.</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/handcuffs.jpg" title="The handcuffs" alt="The handcuffs"><span class="image-caption">The handcuffs</span><h3 id="Table-Stakes-Fitness-Looks-Life"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/03/20/how-to-be-good-at-dating/#Table-Stakes-Fitness-Looks-Life" class="headerlink" title="Table Stakes: Fitness, Looks, Life"></a>Table Stakes: Fitness, Looks, Life</h3><p>Physical fitness is the highest ROI investment in your dating life. Actually in your life in general. It&#39;s entirely within your control, compounds benefits across your entire existence, and dramatically increases your options. Lifting heavy weights will improve your appearance, physical health, mental health, diet, sleep, and interpersonal interactions. Cartesian mind-body dualism is a fiction—your body is you. Hit the gym, lift heavy (aim for 1/2/3/4 pl8s), and get below 15% body fat.</p><p>Women aren&#39;t just selecting for aesthetics—they&#39;re selecting for the discipline, confidence, and vitality that a fit body represents. (And you want to be in a position where you can do the same!) As a bonus, you&#39;ll actually enjoy sex more when you&#39;re not wheezing after 30 seconds of mild exertion. Looking your best isn&#39;t shallow, it&#39;s a sign of respect for yourself and the people you hope to connect with. A fit body is a billboard advertising self-love, and if you can&#39;t love yourself, are you really ready to love someone else?</p><p>Beyond fitness:</p><ul><li>Wear decent clothes that actually fit your body (not what you hope your body looks like).</li><li>Grooming and basic hygiene (shocking how many men fail at this).</li><li>Lead an interesting life that your potential dates would want to be a part of. But do it for yourself first of all.</li></ul><p>These are table stakes. Without them, you&#39;re not even in the game.</p><h3 id="On-the-App"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/03/20/how-to-be-good-at-dating/#On-the-App" class="headerlink" title="On the App"></a>On the App</h3><p>First of all, you need to pay for the apps. The system is pay-to-win, it&#39;s just how it is.</p><h4 id="Pictures"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/03/20/how-to-be-good-at-dating/#Pictures" class="headerlink" title="Pictures"></a>Pictures</h4><p>Dating apps are fundamentally a visual medium. You can either whine about how shallow it all is, or just put in the work and get yourself some good pictures. Up to you. Just know that if you don&#39;t own a good camera or pay for a photographer, you&#39;re not serious about dating and should just delete the apps.</p><p>Your photos should be tailored to your target audience. Want an outdoorsy woman? Hiking pics. Intellectual type? Reading in a cool café. Don&#39;t try to appeal to everyone—polarize deliberately to filter for what you&#39;re actually looking for.</p><p>If you&#39;re serious about dating, you need to move up the photo quality hierarchy: professional photos &gt; actual camera photos &gt; high-quality phone pics. And absolutely nothing else is acceptable.<span class="tooltip"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/03/20/how-to-be-good-at-dating/#fn16923123492" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref16923123492">2</sup></a></span> </p><p>What to do:</p><ul><li>A clear headshot</li><li>A full-body shot that shows your build</li><li>A social pic that proves other humans can sometimes tolerate your presence</li><li>An activity pic showing something you&#39;re passionate about</li><li>A conversation starter that filters for compatibility</li><li>Cute animals</li></ul><p>What not to do:</p><ul><li>Group shots where it&#39;s unclear which person you are</li><li>Sunglasses in every photo</li><li>Photos with women that could be exes</li><li>Photos with babies</li><li>And definitely no fucking pictures with dead animals, what is wrong with you people</li></ul><p>If you have the physique for a shirtless pic, include one, but only in a context that makes sense: at the beach, not a dirty bathroom mirror selfie. If you don&#39;t have the physique, then lift and diet until you do, then take the pic.</p><p>The purpose of these photos isn&#39;t just to show what you look like—they&#39;re telling a story about your life. Make sure it&#39;s a story someone would want to be part of. If your photos show a boring life, don&#39;t be surprised when interesting women swipe left.</p><p>Finally, test your pics. Use PhotoFeeler or just ask female friends which ones work best. Your perception of how you look often doesn&#39;t match reality, and there are stark gendered differences in how pictures are perceived. Guys routinely pick photos where they think they look cool but women find intimidating or off-putting.</p><h4 id="Bio"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/03/20/how-to-be-good-at-dating/#Bio" class="headerlink" title="Bio"></a>Bio</h4><p>Depends on the app. On Hinge, the classic &quot;you, me, us&quot; triad of answers works well: one prompt that describes you, one prompt that describes who you want, and one prompt that describes what life would look like for the two of you together. Again, do not be generic. Do not go for mass appeal. Polarize your audience and filter for what you&#39;re looking for.</p><h4 id="Convos"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/03/20/how-to-be-good-at-dating/#Convos" class="headerlink" title="Convos"></a>Convos</h4><p>App conversations should be brief. Your goal isn&#39;t to build a deep connection through text, it&#39;s to establish basic rapport and move to an in-person meeting ASAP. Three to five exchanges is ideal before suggesting a date, but don&#39;t force it against the flow of conversation.</p><p>Be direct but not desperate. &quot;I&#39;m enjoying our conversation. Want to continue it over drinks?&quot; works better than the endless pen-pal routine many guys fall into. Ask questions, engage with their profile, and respond with something that gives them material to work with. If the convo feels forced, then it&#39;s probably time to move on. If you&#39;re after a kinky casual relationship then it&#39;s perfectly fine to be up-front about it. If you&#39;re after marriage and 4 children you should be up-front about <em>that</em>.</p><div>    <table><tbody>  <tr>    <td><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/dating_convo5.jpg" width="150"></td>    <td><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/dating_convo6.jpg" width="150" height="250"> </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/dating_convo2.jpg" width="150"></td>    <td><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/dating_convo4.jpg" width="150"></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/dating_convo3.jpg" width="150"></td>    <td><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/dating_convo1.jpg" width="150"></td>  </tr></tbody></table>    <div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin: 20px 0;">    Some typical convos. 5/6 did not lead to a date, this is normal.

I don&#39;t really understand why it be like this, but it do. For some reason people feel like they can be incredibly rude when it comes to first dates; this is by far my #1 annoyance with dating apps.<span class="tooltip"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/03/20/how-to-be-good-at-dating/#fn16923123493" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref16923123493">3</sup></a></span></p><p>You are in charge of planning the date; you wouldn&#39;t believe how many men out there don&#39;t have the mental capacity to pick a bar. Pick venues where you can actually talk. Bars work better than restaurants or coffee shops—there&#39;s just enough ambient energy, and alcohol helps loosen people up without the commitment of a full dinner. Activity dates can work if there&#39;s still room for conversation.</p><p>Location matters. Make it convenient for both of you. If you&#39;re planning to get laid, walking distance from your home is a good idea.</p><p>Confirm the day of. A simple &quot;Looking forward to seeing you later&quot; can save you from showing up to an empty bar.</p><h4 id="The-Dates"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/03/20/how-to-be-good-at-dating/#The-Dates" class="headerlink" title="The Dates"></a>The Dates</h4><p>Honestly I don&#39;t have much advice on how to make first dates fun, other than have a good conversation. I&#39;m a shy, introverted nerd and I never really had an issue with this. <a href="https://www.experimental-history.com/p/good-conversations-have-lots-of-doorknobs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This is great advice on being a good conversationalist.</a> </p><p>I think most dating failure comes down to neuroticism, people getting in their own way. They overanalyze, try too hard, and lose their chill the moment they actually like someone. The solution is trivial: relax, stay present, don&#39;t be an idiot. Be open and vulnerable, but also don&#39;t traumadump. Merely knowing this doesn&#39;t make it any easier to follow, though.</p><p>If I was into someone, I would always go for a kiss on the first date (and I highly recommend asking for consent first: &quot;is it alright if I kiss you?&quot;).<span class="tooltip"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/03/20/how-to-be-good-at-dating/#fn16923123494" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref16923123494">4</sup></a></span> </p><p>Connection isn&#39;t always instant. My most significant relationship started with a fairly lukewarm first date., but by the third date we couldn&#39;t keep our hands off each other. If you think the basics are there, give people a chance to open up. First date nerves are real, and some people take longer to show their true selves.</p><h4 id="Sex"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/03/20/how-to-be-good-at-dating/#Sex" class="headerlink" title="Sex"></a>Sex</h4><p>This one really depends on your own tastes. When I was starting out, I tried to have sex as soon as possible after meeting, but I eventually realized that it was better to wait a bit, even for completely casual relationships. Delaying sex to the second date made both of us more comfortable, relaxed, secure, and just generally improved the vibes, which led to better sex and better retention rates.</p><p>That said, I think you should have sex on the first date at least once, just so you know you have it in you. Afterwards you can do whatever you want. It also helps with insecurity issues.</p><p>For serious relationships the trajectory might be a bit longer, but the decision about when to have sex isn&#39;t about following arbitrary rules, it&#39;s about what works for you. Wait as long as you want, but don&#39;t turn it into a power struggle or test. Whether casual or serious, the sex timeline should feel natural, not strategic.</p><h4 id="Rejection"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/03/20/how-to-be-good-at-dating/#Rejection" class="headerlink" title="Rejection"></a>Rejection</h4><p>Rejection hurts. The difference between successful daters and unsuccessful ones isn&#39;t that successful people don&#39;t feel the sting—it&#39;s that they don&#39;t let it stop them. The brutal truth is that you need to get rejected repeatedly until you&#39;re somewhat desensitized, but it never really goes away.</p><p>Remember the numbers game aspect: even with good photos and a solid profile, men will need to swipe hundreds of times for a handful of matches, and many of those matches won&#39;t lead to dates. There will be long stretches where you don&#39;t get any matches. This isn&#39;t a reflection of your worth, it&#39;s just how the system works, and you need to stay grounded and keep grinding.</p><p>Sometimes you&#39;ll fall madly in love and they won&#39;t like you back. The third person I went out with after I started dating was incredible: hot, interesting, weird, it felt like we clicked right away, really a one in a million kind of person. We went on four dates in total. She just wasn&#39;t that into me. It fucked me up real hard, to the point that I was still dreaming about her more than a year later. After just four short dates! It hurt like hell, but in the end it&#39;s all worth it.</p><p>The only guaranteed way to fail is to stop trying.</p><h4 id="Feedback"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/03/20/how-to-be-good-at-dating/#Feedback" class="headerlink" title="Feedback"></a>Feedback</h4><p>Getting better requires feedback, and feedback is really difficult to get in the dating world. People are not exactly incentivized to be honest, and you&#39;ll probably never hear back from your failed dates anyway. One solution is to talk things out with your friends and have them tell you what you&#39;re doing right and wrong, share tips on what you feel is working or not. You can also talk with your partners: after you have dated someone for a while, ask about their impressions of your first few dates. What did they like, what did they not like, how did they see it from their perspective.</p><p>Keep a dating journal. Take notes on what you did, how you reacted to certain situations, what you were afraid to say or do. Experiment on the apps with different pictures, bios, or approaches to conversation. Find what works for you.</p><p>Sometimes the truth is &quot;she wasn&#39;t into you&quot; and there&#39;s nothing to learn. But often, there are things you could be doing better. Dating is a skill, and getting better at that skill means figuring out what you&#39;re doing wrong, fixing it, and then iterating over and over.</p><h2 id="Mindset"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/03/20/how-to-be-good-at-dating/#Mindset" class="headerlink" title="Mindset"></a>Mindset</h2><h3 id="Team-Sport-Not-Battle"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/03/20/how-to-be-good-at-dating/#Team-Sport-Not-Battle" class="headerlink" title="Team Sport, Not Battle"></a>Team Sport, Not Battle</h3><p>The biggest mistake people make in dating is treating it like warfare. They think of the opposite sex as adversaries to be fought through tactics and manipulation. This mindset is not just toxic, also just plain ineffective. Dating is a team sport. When dating is working well, you and your dates are on the same team, working together towards a common goal. You&#39;re not trying to trick someone into bed or a relationship; you&#39;re finding someone who wants the same thing you do. This is an atmosphere that you have to cultivate, and it starts with you making the first move of vulnerability and openness. You must lead by example, and your partners will reciprocate.</p><p>The team sport mentality applies especially in bed. Sex isn&#39;t something you &quot;get&quot; from women—it&#39;s something you create together. The goal isn&#39;t conquest but mutual pleasure. This mindset alone puts you ahead of 90% of men who are focused only on their own gratification or ego. </p><p>The most successful men I know are completely honest about their intentions. Openness and honesty alows potential dates to make an informed decision about whether they want to go out with you. Some will bounce, <em>and this is good</em>, you&#39;ve saved both of your time and the ones who stay are actually on board with what you&#39;re offering.</p><p>I must acknowledge that this is not an easy thing to do. If you are insecure about your appearance, personality, experience, skills, or anything else, it&#39;s natural to try to hide away and refuse to confront that. When I started dating I was terribly ashamed of sharing the details of my 15 years of monk mode and was totally dishonest about it. It felt awful, and of course my dates picked up on the insincerity. I quickly learned that I had to be open about these things. And two years later when I met my current girlfriend, one of the things that initially pulled her in was my weird sexual history: turns out it was not even a weakness. </p><p>This extends to seeing multiple people too. The mental gymnastics guys do to hide this are absurd. Just say, &quot;I&#39;m seeing other people as well.&quot; Most women in the app ecosystem are doing the same. Transparency creates trust, even in casual arrangements, and trust is necessary if you want to have great sex. This is partly why women trust me to tie them up with 20 meters of rope just a couple of hours after we first meet.</p><p>Another benefit of honesty is that it attracts honest people and pushes away everyone else. People who play games (which is generally a symptom of insecurities) tend to match up with other people who play games, a perfect little soup of toxicity. Again, some will bounce, <em>and this is good</em>.</p><p>Above all, do not be ashamed of your sexuality. Sexual desire isn&#39;t something to apologize for or disguise behind fake intentions. It&#39;s not something to trick people into satisfying. Women are horny too, and great sex can be a profound experience. Confidence in your desires is magnetic. It signals self-respect. You&#39;re not desperate; you&#39;re selective. You know what you want, you are offering something valuable, and you&#39;re looking for compatible partners.</p><p>This brings me to standards. Have them. High ones. Not just for physical appearance, but for personality, intelligence, kindness. If the women you&#39;re meeting aren&#39;t worth talking to, <em>that&#39;s on you</em>. Make yourself worthy of more interesting women. Build a life that attracts the kind of partner you want—whether for a night or forever.</p><p>Honesty is always difficult and always a work in progress. Nobody is perfect. But approaching dating with transparency isn&#39;t just ethically superior, it&#39;s pragmatically superior. It leads to better connections, better sex, better relationships, and less wasted time.</p><h3 id="Authenticity-amp-Connection"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/03/20/how-to-be-good-at-dating/#Authenticity-amp-Connection" class="headerlink" title="Authenticity &amp; Connection"></a>Authenticity &amp; Connection</h3><h4 id="Be-Genuine-ly-cool"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/03/20/how-to-be-good-at-dating/#Be-Genuine-ly-cool" class="headerlink" title="Be Genuine(ly cool)"></a>Be Genuine(ly cool)</h4><p><em>Your job in dating isn&#39;t to make people like you</em>—it&#39;s to be your best self and see who&#39;s compatible.</p><p>Stop sweating all the small stuff. When to kiss, how to escalate, negging, how long to wait until to text, being suave 24/7 with some James Bond quip always up your sleeve. None of that matters much. Just chill. Just be nice. <em>Be cool, honey bunny.</em> A woman who wants to fuck you will make it easy for you. Cooperate with her! You are not enemies, you are not fighting over control of a scarce resource, you are on the same team, looking for the same thing. </p><p>I&#39;ve often asked women to come back to my place without even having kissed them. No elaborate escalation ladder, no push/pull, no &quot;3 points of contact before suggesting location change&quot;, none of that bullshit. Just a pleasant chat over a drink or two and &quot;we should get out of here, want to go back to my place?&quot; If she&#39;s into you, this works. If she&#39;s not, no technique in the world will change that. It&#39;s true that some people use sex as a tool in relationship power dynamics; you should stay far, far away from them, and that will just happen naturally as long as you stay true to yourself.</p><h4 id="Nice-Guys-Finish-On-Her-Face"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/03/20/how-to-be-good-at-dating/#Nice-Guys-Finish-On-Her-Face" class="headerlink" title="Nice Guys Finish On Her Face"></a>Nice Guys Finish On Her Face</h4><p>Women really like guys who are nice. Not &quot;nice guys&quot; who are nice from a place of weakness, from a place of dishonesty, neediness, insecurity, hiding their intentions, etc. Women like it when you are nice from a place of confidence, strength, and magnanimity, when it&#39;s genuine. Sometimes the nice thing to do is tie someone up and spank them until they cry. Being genuinely nice means being attuned to what the other person actually wants, not what you think you&#39;re supposed to provide. And it definitely doesn&#39;t mean concocting hidden agreements where you expect to receive something in return for your niceness. So be nice.</p><p>The foundation of all meaningful connection is honesty and vulnerability. You need to make the first step here—show your cards before asking to see theirs. When you&#39;re vulnerable first, you create space for the other person to reciprocate. This doesn&#39;t mean trauma-dumping on a first date, but it does mean being real about what you want, what you enjoy, and who you are.</p><h4 id="Casual-Sex-Attitudes"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/03/20/how-to-be-good-at-dating/#Casual-Sex-Attitudes" class="headerlink" title="Casual Sex Attitudes"></a>Casual Sex Attitudes</h4><p>One of the weirder discoveries of my dating adventures was women&#39;s bizarre relationship with casual sex. Many are having it despite not particularly enjoying it. They&#39;re often chasing the feeling of being desired rather than pleasure itself. I&#39;ve slept with beautiful women who admitted they don&#39;t really enjoy hookups but keep doing it anyway. When I asked why, the answers were all variations of &quot;I like feeling wanted&quot; or &quot;It&#39;s validating&quot; or just &quot;well it was something to do&quot;. For them, sex is an abundant but joyless resource: easily gained, but almost never satisfying.</p><p>This divorce between sex and pleasure was a big surprise for me. The act has somehow become weirdly performative, less about the actual raw experience itself and more about what it represents. Are you sexually liberated? Desirable? Normal? The apps amplify this dynamic by creating an endless marketplace of validation where actual human connection is almost beside the point. People mindlessly performing scripts about freedom and desire while feeling increasingly alienated from both. </p><p>This mind-fucked dynamic explains a lot about modern dating, honestly. When neither party is primarily motivated by actual desire or connection, is it any wonder most casual sex is so mediocre? The good news is that you can easily set yourself apart by crushing the competition on this front.</p><h4 id="Sexual-Compatibility"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/03/20/how-to-be-good-at-dating/#Sexual-Compatibility" class="headerlink" title="Sexual Compatibility"></a>Sexual Compatibility</h4><p>Whether you are looking for something casual or a life partner, sexual compatibility is non-negotiable. Different people have radically different preferences, but are usually very reticent about discussing them up front; this is how you end up divorced 5 years down the line. Some women want romance and tenderness; others want to be thrown against the wall and degraded. Some prioritize their pleasure; others get off primarily on yours. There&#39;s no universal &quot;good at sex&quot;—there&#39;s only &quot;good at sex with this particular person.&quot;</p><p>This is why sexual honesty is crucial. It filters out mismatches before emotional investment makes the inevitable split more painful. The right sexual match creates a feedback loop of mutually reinforcing desire and fulfillment that elevates the entire relationship. The physical connection elevates the mental one and vice versa. When you&#39;re sexually compatible, everything else becomes easier: communication improves, resentment decreases, and your bond deepens through shared vulnerability. Do not, under any circumstances, settle for mediocre sex</p><p>If you want better than mediocre—and you should—then aim higher. Be honest, be present, be genuinely interested in your partner&#39;s pleasure, and be good at sex (more on that in my next essay). The bar is so low it&#39;s practically underground.</p><h2 id="Intentionality-Design-Your-Relationships"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/03/20/how-to-be-good-at-dating/#Intentionality-Design-Your-Relationships" class="headerlink" title="Intentionality: Design Your Relationships"></a>Intentionality: Design Your Relationships</h2><p>Being authentic goes hand in hand with being intentional. Most people are not really choosing their relationships. They&#39;re just stumbling into whatever arrangement emerges from unconscious social scripts. They fuck on date 3 because they&#39;re supposed to fuck on date 3, they go exclusive because that&#39;s what you do after a while, they move in together because rent is expensive, and then they wake up five years later wondering what the fuck happened.</p><p>Intentional dating means actively designing your relationships rather than letting them happen to you. This starts with brutal honesty about what you actually want. Not what you think you should want, not what dating coaches say you should pursue, but what genuinely brings you fulfillment.</p><p>This is another thing that&#39;s going to limit your target audience, but ulltimately works in your favor. Yes, being upfront about wanting casual arrangements means that many people will swip left, but the ones who match are actually going to be interested in the same thing. No wasted evenings, no disappointed expectations, no messy situationships.<span class="tooltip"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/03/20/how-to-be-good-at-dating/#fn16923123495" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref16923123495">5</sup></a></span></p><p>This intentionality should extend to all aspects of a relationship. A friend of mine told me the story of her first divorce: he was her first boyfriend, they had been dating for 8 years starting in college, and eventually decided to get married. So they have a lovely ceremony, exchange vows, eat cakes and all that, and the next day the husband says: &quot;time to start trying for kids now&quot;. She was absolutely horrified as she had absolutely no intention of having kids with him. This is an extreme example, but people go through relationships based on unstated assumptions and expectations when it comes to jealousy, communication, security, living arrangements, life goals, and how to enhance each others&#39; lives that are often totally incorrect. </p><p>The most successful relationships are those that involve two people who act as conscious architects and not passive participants. This might sound clinical, but it actually creates space for deeper emotional connection. When the structural elements are clear, you can focus on actually enjoying each other rather than constantly renegotiating unspoken rules. Do not let life just happen to you. Have you tried trying?</p><h2 id="Yes-But"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/03/20/how-to-be-good-at-dating/#Yes-But" class="headerlink" title="Yes, But..."></a>Yes, But...</h2><p><strong>&quot;But Alvaro, I&#39;m too fat/ugly/old to succeed at dating.&quot;</strong></p><p>Have you put in consistent effort at the gym for a year? Have you optimized your diet? Have you invested in clothes that actually fit? Have you gotten professional photos? No? Then you haven&#39;t actually tested this hypothesis. These are all easily fixable issues, and you just need to stop complaining and put in the work. You don&#39;t need to be a male model—you just need to be the best version of yourself.</p><p><strong>&quot;But Alvaro, I&#39;m too short. Women won&#39;t date men under 6 feet.&quot;</strong></p><p>I&#39;m not going to tell you that height preferences are not real. They can be brutal, and they are totally unfair. But if you&#39;re fixating on the women who reject you for immutable characteristics rather than focusing on the many who don&#39;t care, you&#39;re creating your own prison. The height issue is real, but the impact is wildly exaggerated by men looking for an uncontrollable excuse for controllable failures.</p><p><strong>&quot;But Alvaro, I&#39;m socially awkward/on the spectrum/have anxiety.&quot;</strong></p><p>What do you think my social skills looked like after 15 years of monk mode? I get social anxiety all the time, and from the silliest things. But social skills are just that—skills. They can be learned and improved like any other. As long as you keep practicing intentionally, figuring out what you can do better, and keep putting yourself in new and uncomfortable situations, you <em>will</em> improve. The alternative to that is to resign yourself to using your temporary weaknesses as a permanent excuse, which guarantees failure.</p><p><strong>&quot;But Alvaro, there are no interesting women in my area.&quot;</strong></p><p>Have you tried living somewhere else? I&#39;m entirely serious. If dating is important to you and your location is legitimately terrible for it, moving is a rational decision. I&#39;ve known people who relocated primarily for dating prospects. Besides, most likely, there are interesting women around you—you&#39;re just not interesting enough to attract them yet. Focus on building a life and personality that naturally draws in the kind of people you want to meet.</p><p><strong>&quot;But Alvaro, the dating market is rigged against average men.&quot;</strong></p><p>Is the market difficult? Yes. Is it &quot;rigged&quot;? No. The problem is that most men are putting in minimal effort while expecting exceptional results. They have terrible photos, boring lives, mediocre fizeeks, and underdeveloped social skills, yet somehow believe they deserve supermodel girlfriends who fall into their laps without effort.</p><p>Dating markets are <em>highly</em> efficient. You generally get what you&#39;re worth. Tinder is a mirror disguised as a window. If you&#39;re not getting what you want, you have two options: improve your market value or adjust your expectations. Both require honest self-assessment and real effort.</p><p><strong>&quot;But Alvaro, I don&#39;t have time for all this.&quot;</strong></p><p>Then you don&#39;t have time for dating. If you can&#39;t commit a few hours a week to swiping, a few hours in the gym, and a few hours on dates, you&#39;re not actually prioritizing this area of your life. That&#39;s fine, but admit it&#39;s a choice rather than pretending it&#39;s an impossibility.</p><h2 id="Wrapping-Up"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/03/20/how-to-be-good-at-dating/#Wrapping-Up" class="headerlink" title="Wrapping Up"></a>Wrapping Up</h2><p>Dating is a skill like any other. I went from a decade and a half of celibacy to more casual sex than I knew what to do with, and ultimately to finding someone truly remarkable. You just need to work on it, try different things, iterate, improve yourself. Love thyself. Do not lower your standards, do not accept &quot;good enough&quot; in yourself or others, do not hide behind masks that attract the wrong people. Focus on what you&#39;re best at, but don&#39;t be terrible at anything. I&#39;m not claiming everyone will achieve identical results with identical effort. What I am saying is that nearly everyone can substantially improve from their current baseline, whatever that may be.</p><p>Most men fall into one of two categories: the reliable &quot;boyfriend material&quot; guy who fails to inspire true desire, or the exciting &quot;fuckboy&quot; who can&#39;t maintain a meaningful connection. The sweet spot is being both—reliable enough to trust but exciting and hot enough to desire. It&#39;s not about being perfect at everything, but about being good enough across the board. It&#39;s about honesty and skills and confidence. When you&#39;re not constantly worried about hiding your insecurities or playing tactical games, you can be present and actually enjoy the person across from you.</p><p>I cannot emphasize enough that the same principles serve both casual and serious dating. Honesty, vulnerability, self-respect, and intentionality create better experiences across the board. These aren&#39;t just ethical considerations—they&#39;re pragmatic strategies that lead to better sex, better connections, and less wasted time.</p><p>Much of this post focuses on casual dating, but most people will eventually get bored of that, and finding the right teammate changes everything. When you meet someone who genuinely gets you, who wants the same things you do, the entire experience transforms. Dating stops feeling like a grinding job interview process and becomes an exciting collaboration. The right partner will enhance your life, pushing you to grow to ever greater heights.</p><p>Approaching dating with intentionality and treating it as a skill to be developed changes everything. Your dating life isn&#39;t happening to you; you&#39;re actively creating it. You are in control of your romantic destiny.</p><hr><p>Further reading, in case six thousand words on dating wasn&#39;t enough for you:</p><ul><li><a href="https://putanumonit.com/2016/02/03/015-dating_1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Putanumonit: Dating: a Research Journal, Part 1</a></li><li><a href="http://livingwithinreason.com/2014/11/26/most-online-dating-advice-is-terrible/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Most Online Dating Advice is Terrible</a></li></ul><p>Stay tuned for the final installment in the series, How to be Good at Sex.</p><div class="subscribediv" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:250px;margin-top:30px;"><form class="validate" action="https://fantasticanachronism.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=2a6ff66ec7039625cb12680d5&amp;amp;id=f713c1306c" method="post" id="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" target="_blank"><div class="mc-field-group"><input class="required email" type="email" name="EMAIL" id="mce-EMAIL" placeholder="Type your email..." value></div><div class="clear" id="mce-responses"><div class="respose" id="mce-error-response" style="display:none"></div><div class="respose" id="mce-success-response" style="display:none"></div></div><div style="position: absolute; left: -5000px" aria-hidden="true"><input type="text" name="b_2a6ff66ec7039625cb12680d5_f713c1306c" tabindex="-1" value></div><div class="clear"><input type="submit" value="Subscribe" name="subscribe" id="mc-embedded-subscribe" clas="button"></div></form></div><div id="footnotes"><hr><div id="footnotelist"><ol style="list-style: none; padding-left: 0; margin-left: 40px"><li id="fn16923123491"><span style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; padding-right: 10px; margin-left: -40px">1.</span><span><span class="footnote-contents">&quot;But Alvaro, what if I don't like spitting on women?&quot; Stop being such a pussy, she needs your saliva to achieve orgasm, do your patriotic duty and help the poor girl out. <em>Dulce et decorum est pro patria conspuere in socium facies.</em> If you try it and still don't like it, then <em>fine</em>, I guess...</span><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/03/20/how-to-be-good-at-dating/#fnref16923123491" rev="footnote"> ↩</a></span></li><li id="fn16923123492"><span style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; padding-right: 10px; margin-left: -40px">2.</span><span><span class="footnote-contents">My photos were good but not great, I could have optimized them more, and it almost certainly cost me matches.

    <updated>2025-03-11T12:06:26.777Z</updated>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Closure. I keep hearing that word.</p></div></blockquote><p>Of the qualities which ordinarily raise novels to eminence, <em>Bouvard et Pécuchet</em> has absolutely none. It is unfinished. It is a failure on almost every level: it is gimmicky, repetitive, the characters are shallow, there is no plot, it is supposedly comedic but never funny, and it <em>tells</em> instead of <em>showing</em> at every turn. Flaubert was well aware of its faults, writing to Émile Zola that &quot;there are no quotable excerpts, no brilliant scenes, just the same situation over and over…&quot; Yet this novel counts among its admirers Borges, Calvino, and Pound. Bolaño classes it among the &quot;great, imperfect, torrential works that blaze paths into the unknown&quot;, while Gass says that &quot;it is not for the faintly minded. It is a devastation, a blowup as total as the bomb&quot;. </p><h2 id="Laurel-and-Hardy-at-Epidaurus"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/03/11/the-artist-imitates-the-art-flaubert-s-bouvard-et-pecuchet/#Laurel-and-Hardy-at-Epidaurus" class="headerlink" title="Laurel and Hardy at Epidaurus"></a>Laurel and Hardy at Epidaurus</h2><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>On a horizon that receded further each day, they glimpsed things at once strange and wondrous.</p></div></blockquote><p>The year is 1872. Flaubert starts working on something he&#39;s had on his mind for a very long time. The intention is to write a comic novel of ideas, viciously skewering the stupidity he sees everywhere around him. At its center will be two fools, a slapstick duo of dilettantes who embody everything that is wrong with the world and are justly punished for it—a picaresque of knowledge starring two Quixotes and no Sancho. In their adventures they will try their hand at virtually every art and science known to man, from horticulture to theology—and fail, painfully, at every single point. In a letter, he writes:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>I’m contemplating something in which I’ll vent all my anger. Yes, at last I shall rid myself of what is stifling me. I shall vomit back onto my contemporaries the disgust they inspire in me, even if it means ripping my chest open.</p></div></blockquote><p>But Flaubert is nothing if not a perfectionist, and if he must write about stupidity then he must first make a comprehensive survey of it. He reads one tome. He reads ten. He reads a hundred. By the time he reaches one thousand it is clear that he&#39;s still nowhere near the end. In 1879 he announces to Zola that he has finally finished his readings and will not open another book until the novel is done, but before long he finds himself lost in the pages of yet more ecclesiastical texts. By the end of his life (which will not be long enough to complete his work) he will have read more than 1500 books in his quest to understand the minds of François Denys Bartholomée <em>Bouvard</em> and Juste Romain Cyrille <em>Pécuchet</em>.</p><!--- And to do that he decides to transform himself into an "encyclopedia of the universe". ---><p>He&#39;s never really sure about the work, writing to his sister in 1877 that &quot;at times, the immense scope of this book stuns me. What will come of it? I only hope I’m not deceiving myself into writing something goofy rather than sublime.&quot; In another letter he writes that &quot;one must be mad to undertake such a task.&quot; And between all this, he is also repudiating his earlier style, deconstructing and demolishing the conventions of the realist novel, replacing them with irony, self-reference, and the endless fragmentation of language and meaning. The line between author and characters is blurred, the linear becomes circular, and the very act of reading itself is interrogated as Flaubert inaugurates the 20th century modernist tradition in literature</p><h2 id="They-Gave-Up"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/03/11/the-artist-imitates-the-art-flaubert-s-bouvard-et-pecuchet/#They-Gave-Up" class="headerlink" title="They Gave Up"></a>They Gave Up</h2><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>What a sad paradox, thought Amalfitano.</p></div></blockquote><p>The novel follows two Parisian copy-clerks who meet by chance and quickly bond over their shared intellectual curiosity. When Bouvard unexpectedly inherits a fortune, they retire together to the countryside to devote their lives to learning and self-improvement. Flaubert shoves his characters into a labyrinth of intellectual disciplines and subjects them to relentless misfortune; barely a paragraph goes by without some absurd failure; there is no pause, no space whatsoever for comedic timing, and the joke unfolds in the same way every time—with the inevitability of a mathematical proof. </p><p>The vicious cycle begins with curiosity, moves on to true belief, then disillusionment and contrarianism, only for them to give up at the end. A series of grand revelations, each leading nowhere, or worse, back to the beginning. And was the journey worth it? Flaubert offers no answer to that question. The pace is astonishing: in the span of a few paragraphs, they become theologians, stumble on the <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/03/15/answer-to-job/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">answer to Job</a>, get depressed, and quit.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Our world is therefore but a point in the totality of things—and our universe, which the intelligence cannot penetrate, only one universe in an infinity of neighboring universes with infinite modifications.

It was too much. They gave up.</p></div></blockquote><!-- that's all in response to spinoza btw --><p>When they tire of studying things, they begin studying the discourse about them instead. While trying to understand history, they acquire a totalizing notion of historical truth which is then subverted <em>in the same paragraph</em>; they then immediately move on to historiography, only to find themselves stuck in yet another <em>cul-de-sac</em>. </p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>They no longer had a single fixed idea about the individuals and events of that time. To form an impartial judgment, they would have to read every history, every memoir, every newspaper and manuscript, for the slightest omission could foster an error that would lead to others, and on unto infinity. They gave up. But they had acquired a taste for history, a need for truth for its own sake. Perhaps the truth was more easily uncovered in earlier periods? Surely the authors recounted events more dispassionately at a greater remove. And they delved into the good Rollin. “What a load of hogwash!” cried Bouvard as of the first chapter.</p></div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Having stopped caring about dates, they moved on to disdaining facts. What counted was the philosophy of history!</p></div></blockquote><!-- "The Religion chapter clearly reveals this cycle, which carries the protagonists from curiosity to a faint nostalgia, to a will to believe, to disillusion, and ultimately to a liberation through disgust." --><!-- deploys learning, rapid pace, etc. --><p>The first moment of true pathos only appears near the end of the novel, as our two protagonists reach their nadir and decide to commit suicide. Just as they are about to hang themselves, they are saved by the gleam of distant lanterns, lit in celebration of a midnight mass, only for the Sisyphean torment to begins anew. They go from suicidal, to being saved by religion, to fanatics of the faith spending a fortune on relics, to skeptics and Spinozists, to mythologists debating priests, to Buddhism (first ironically, then really), and finally to liberation by way of disgust. </p><h2 id="C-39-est-moi"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/03/11/the-artist-imitates-the-art-flaubert-s-bouvard-et-pecuchet/#C-39-est-moi" class="headerlink" title="C&#39;est moi"></a>C&#39;est moi</h2><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Certain authors extol the pleasures of a picnic or a boat ride.</p></div></blockquote><p>At some point Flaubert discovers that he has been writing about himself all along. What appeared to him as a comic work of social criticism (what was <em>intended</em> as a work of social criticism), ends up being a melancholic meditation on his own being. The act of writing this novel has forced him into the same kind of bookish learning and bewildered ascetic impulse that he mockingly inflicts on his characters. Driven by a barren obsession for knowledge, he has turned himself into an encylopedia of the universe and alienated himself from the real world. The impulse had always existed in Flaubert: decades earlier, in 1854, he wrote in a letter to Louise Colet: &quot;One ought to know everything, to write!&quot;</p><p>He writes to Turgenev in a moment of despair, confessing: &quot;At times, it seems to me that I am becoming idiotic.&quot; Perhaps this should not surprise us from the man who said &quot;<em>Madame Bovary, c&#39;est moi.</em>&quot; It certainly surprised him though:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Bouvard and Pecuchet have filled me up to such a point that I have become them! Their stupidity is my own and I am bursting with it….I live as much as I can in my two fellows…the stupidity of my two characters has invaded me.</p></div></blockquote><p>As Flaubert becomes more like them, they become more like Flaubert, disenchanted, dissatisfied, and disappointed with everything they see around them:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Then their minds developed a piteous faculty, that of perceiving stupidity and being unable to tolerate it. Insignificant things saddened them: newspaper advertisements, a burgher’s profile, an inane comment overheard by chance. And reflecting on what was said in their village, and on the fact that one could find other Coulons, other Marescots, other Foureaus stretching to the ends of the earth, they felt upon their shoulders the weight of the entire world.</p></div></blockquote><!-- The reciprocal relationship between Flaubert and his characters mirrors the cyclical nature of their journey: as they increasingly become mirrors of each other, the dissatisfaction with the world and the limits of our understanding grows worse and worse.  --><p>By the end of the novel they are little more than stand-ins, and Flaubert even grants them the authorship of his own <em>Dictionary of Received Ideas</em>.</p><p>And if Flaubert is writing about himself, what does he have to say on the subject? He writes about an infinite curiosity that is always subverted by human finitude; he suffers simultaneously from a superabundance of learning and a desire that will never be quenched. And the novel, too, is torn in opposite directions: between comedy and tragedy, between greed for experience and a corrosive suspicion of Ideas. </p><p>Ideas and pain are inextricably linked, right from the beginning: &quot;...their newfound curiosity caused their intelligence to bloom. [...] And, having more ideas, they suffered more acutely.&quot; Imagine Faust—<em>sans Mephistopheles</em>! And while our heroes abandon every field they touch, they never give up the greater quest. The struggle of Bouvard and Pécuchet (and Flaubert (and me (and you))) is not comic, but tragic and Romantic—they and he and we are not buffoons but martyrs, tortured and broken on the wheel of the human condition.</p><!-- He writes about the desire for self-improvement, the desire for progress. --><!-- > One ought to know everything, to write! [...] Books that have been the source of entire literatures, like Homer or Rabelais, contain the sum of all knowledge of their times.--><!-- **It is Flaubert in person who is transforming himself into an encyclopedia of the universe, assimilating with a passion in no way inferior to that of his heroes every scrap of the knowledge that they sought to make their own, and all that they are destined to be excluded from. Did he toil so long to demonstrate the vanity of knowledge as exploited by his two self-educated heroes? Or was it to demonstrate the vanity of knowledge pure and simple?** --><h2 id="The-Problem-of-Knowledge"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/03/11/the-artist-imitates-the-art-flaubert-s-bouvard-et-pecuchet/#The-Problem-of-Knowledge" class="headerlink" title="The Problem of Knowledge"></a>The Problem of Knowledge</h2><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>I&#39;ve studied now Philosophy<br>And Jurisprudence, Medicine,—<br>And even, alas!

Some of the mysteries they fail at are actually very conquerable.] --><!-- Definitely a satire of pedantry/superficiality. But also their incessant need to move on is understandable in a way. Their constant movement from one discipline to another can be seen not as a failure, but as an acknowledgment of the vastness and complexity of knowledge. --><p>Are the failures of Bouvard and Pécuchet a commentary on our norms of knowledge? Is the problem with the people, their sources, or how they handle them? Is it a declaration of the triumph of skepticism over truth? Is it a more general attack on Western civilization (as Gass would have it)? Or is it perhaps a condemnation of the entire universe?</p><p>The original subtitle of the novel was &quot;An Encyclopedia of Human Stupidity&quot;, which was later changed to &quot;On Lack of Method in the Sciences&quot;. This change represents a shift in how Flaubert saw his task: it started as a mere attack on the follies of his contemporaries, but in the end it was a much broader assault. The flaws of the characters are still there, but they are not imbeciles: in many ways their faults are understandable.</p><p>While the overall structure repeats itself, the actual errors they commit are diverse: sometimes it&#39;s a matter of an over-reliance on book learning, at other times it&#39;s an issue of science vs <em>metis</em>. Sometimes it&#39;s a question of stupid experimental methods, while at other times it&#39;s a matter of social epistemology. Flaubert systematically dismantles epistemic authority, pitting each source against another in a cascade of contradictions. His protagonists&#39; earnest curiosity is crushed by the disorienting barrage of information that assaults them from every direction. </p><p>The fields they try to tackle are too vast and too complex, so they are too fast, too shallow, and fail to synthesize or think critically. They see knowledge as a <em>conclusion</em>, when it should be a <em>process</em>. They fail to realize the limits of their knowledge. Even when they do acquire some truth, they put it into practice in the wrong way. They believe that knowledge is acquired easily, and once acquired will solve all problems.</p><p>But Bouvard and Pécuchet are not just bad learners—Flaubert&#39;s true concern runs deeper: they are constantly striving for meaning in a world that resists clear answers. Their epistemological failure is a minor reflection of a much greater existential failure. Their desperate search for meaning in a universe that is indifferent to such inquiries leads only to alienation and disappointment. </p><p>Flaubert is not interested in specific epistemological criticisms: those questions are left open to interpretation and that&#39;s part of the appeal. Flaubert&#39;s ultimate target is the pursuit of absolute truth, epistemological certainty, the idea of reaching the end of thought. He declares that ineptitude is not understanding the twilight.</p><p>&quot;Yes, stupidity consists in wanting to conclude. We are a thread and we want to know the pattern. [...] What mind of any strength—beginning with Homer—has ever come to a conclusion?&quot; And this novel certainly revels in its refusal to conclude! For Flaubert, the search for knowledge is an existential trap, a synecdoche for the futility of reaching any kind of certainty or ultimate purpose. Both for him as for his characters, this quest for knowledge leads only to disorientation.</p><!-- More broadly though, the novel critiques the idea that knowledge and progress can be gained through simple accumulation of information. --><!-- thought his target was "concluding", [elaborate on this -- stopping thinking because you believe you have reached the end] reaching absolute Truths which were beyond our grasp. He condemns us for chasing certainty, seeking the rigor of angels. For wanting the universe to be black and white when it's just shades of grey. In a letter, he writes --><!-- [GPT: What makes the novel fascinating is that these readings aren't mutually exclusive. Bouvard and Pécuchet can be seen as failures because they misunderstand science, philosophy, or even the nature of knowledge itself--and all of these angles provide valuable insights into the novel's thematic richness.] --><!-- IT'S NOT JUST THAT THE SEARCH FOR KNOWLEDGE IS BAD, THEY ALSO CONDUCT IT BADLY --><!-- More on the existential nature of the novel, more on the epistemology? How do we really connect the two sides? --><!-- [the quote about stupidity = wanting to reach a conclusion...Did Flaubert end up ironically doing exactly what he wanted to denounce? Is B&P an attempt at concluding? Quote is from 1850! Letter to Bouilhet, also discussing the dictionary. In it he mentions that the reader should never know if his leg was being pulled or not -- can't even make a conclusion about that.Views philosophy as particularly prone to concluding, totalizing and closed off systems etc."Ineptitude is...not understanding the twilight; it is wanting only midnight or noon"Derrida writes that this stupidity exerts a "diabolical fascination on flaubert" Is the first sentence there contradictory in the phrasing, if the book is really about concluding?Bouvard and Pécuchet's endless quest for knowledge is a representation of this search for meaning, and their ultimate failure can be seen as a commentary on the inherent meaninglessness of life. Humans are powerless in the face of the universe and its complexities.[It's getting a bit too long, maybe merge this section with the next?] --><!-- [Borges: "Enchanted by its rigor, humanity forgets over and again that it is a rigor of chess masters, not of angels."] --><!-- Like Faust, something beyond the limits of the human. --><!-- What if Faust lacked even the consolation of the devil? Besides, the limits of knowledge in his era seem so slight to us. The comparison has been made many times, but the cases are slightly different. While Faust's tragedy is about transcending the limits of human knowledge, Bouvard and Pécuchet's concerns an infinite and meaningless drive that leaves its victims unsatisfied. [cut but retain quote? Cut the whole thing, don't bother elaborating...maybe just retain the below]. Imagine Faust *sans Mephistopheles*! --><!-- "Although Faust was already possessed by this alienating drive for knowledge, his tragedy is above all a tragedy of finitude, desire and time. Instead, Bouvard and Pécuchet‘s unending journey is the tale of a seemingly infinite compulsive drive." --><!-- ", the thirst for Truth of his two heroes, their true redeeming passion, is the (artistic) truth Flaubert is aiming at. [...] The two copyists schizophrenically embody the impossible reconciliation of an increasingly meaningless drive for knowledge and an all too human desire for meaning and truth." --><!-- It is a novel of ideas on two levels: it concerns a vast number of specific ideas, but also the very notion of Ideas in general. --><!-- The trueambiguity and meaning of Bouvard et Pecuchet mustprobably be assessed in such a "Faustian" perspective. Foronly someone profoundly suspicious of ideas, but alsopassionately attracted to them, could have written suchan unlikely book. Much of the Romantic and post-Romanticvision is summed up by these Faustian dialectics. Thevoice of the Devil, the corrosive voice of doubt and pessimism, proclaims that the Dreamer or Thinker (the "Kerl,der spekuliert") is the fool. **But another voice, no less insistent, somehow manages to affirm that the pursuit of"Vernunft" and "Wissenschaft"-even in the parody-formof two mediocre clerks' fruitless odyssey—remains man'shighest virtue.** --><h2 id="One-Must-Imagine-Flaubert-Happy"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/03/11/the-artist-imitates-the-art-flaubert-s-bouvard-et-pecuchet/#One-Must-Imagine-Flaubert-Happy" class="headerlink" title="One Must Imagine Flaubert Happy"></a>One Must Imagine Flaubert Happy</h2><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>End with a view of our two heroes leaning over their desk, copying.</p></div></blockquote><p><em>Bouvard et Pécuchet</em> is an <em>Ecclesiastes</em> for the 20th century. For Qohelet this was all tragic. For Flaubert, it&#39;s an unintentional tragicomedy. For both, it&#39;s an existential torment. While Qohelet has a way &quot;out&quot; (unsatisfying as it is) in God, Flaubert has no such option. We moderns, having ripped off the theological blinders of our forefathers, can appreciate the cosmic irony, and—perhaps—laugh back at it. While the ancient existentialist can preach a sense of acceptance and resignation, Flaubert instead gives us...<em>The Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog</em>, except the wanderer is about to trip and fall under the fog again.</p><!-- [The greatest of human ambitions are subverted, man is doomed to eternal dissatisfaction as his yearnings will never be fulfilled, and the one last emergency exit from this nightmare--God--is no longer accessible to us.] --><!-- ACTUALLY THE FOLLOWING IS WRONG: The one consolation this novel can offer us is a Romantic view of the heroic quest for ideas, a feeling that the fight (though silly and pointless and doomed) is a justification in itself, and a worthy--in fact, perhaps the highest--task, one that could justify or redeem our limited existence. Who can fault them for taking on the infinite, and failing? --><p>Bouvard and Pécuchet act out of compulsion, convinced that the next piece of knowledge will somehow save them, redeem them, or justify their existence, but it never does. The universe, for Flaubert, is not only meaningless and indifferent, it is also indecipherable. We are doomed to absurdity and contradiction. Even at our best, we may only ever reach the truth of chessmasters, never that of angels.</p><p>This sense of futility is not just reflected in the characters—it was Flaubert&#39;s experience in writing the novel itself. It&#39;s fitting that a book against concluding was left unfinished, almost feels like it&#39;s part of the joke. A great work of circularity, with no ending of its own! It even infects its readers: I have been writing this review for more than two years now. The irony of an unfinished novel about the impossibility of finality speaks louder than any conclusion could.</p><p>In the novel&#39;s intended finale, after so many futile attempts to learn and improve themselves, Bouvard and Pécuchet would return to copying, caught in an eternal loop of seeking, failing, and beginning again. Whether this vision is beatific or horrific is left to the reader to decide.</p><p>Every year, despite my best efforts, my to-read list gets longer. Soon it will exceed what I can reasonably hope to achieve before my death. Like Bouvard, like Pécuchet, like Flaubert, like all men—I am destined to spend my meager allotment of time chasing an ever-receding horizon. We are doomed to seek, knowing we will never arrive. </p><!-- _Ars Longa, Vita Brevis_. --><!-- Perhaps the comedy ultimately lies in the accelerating pace with which they pick up, examine, etc. all these ideas? Nah. --><!-- Attempting to rank *Bouvard et Pécuchet* among Flaubert's other work is a meaningless exercise—this is a work of an entirely different order, a work which signals the end of the realist novel and inaugurates the 20th century modernist tradition in literature.--><!-- An anti-bildungsroman? --><!-- Borges: he was the first to shatter the realist novel. --><div class="subscribediv" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:250px;margin-top:30px;"><form class="validate" action="https://fantasticanachronism.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=2a6ff66ec7039625cb12680d5&amp;amp;id=f713c1306c" method="post" id="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" target="_blank"><div class="mc-field-group"><input class="required email" type="email" name="EMAIL" id="mce-EMAIL" placeholder="Type your email..." value></div><div class="clear" id="mce-responses"><div class="respose" id="mce-error-response" style="display:none"></div><div class="respose" id="mce-success-response" style="display:none"></div></div><div style="position: absolute; left: -5000px" aria-hidden="true"><input type="text" name="b_2a6ff66ec7039625cb12680d5_f713c1306c" tabindex="-1" value></div><div class="clear"><input type="submit" value="Subscribe" name="subscribe" id="mc-embedded-subscribe" clas="button"></div></form></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A Cypriot friend of mine (who wishes to remain anonymous) has produced some new translations of Cavafy in a modest private printing.

After a long impatience, the senate, the clergy, and the people went forth to meet their hero, with tears and acclamations, with olive branches and innumerable lamps; he entered the capital in a chariot drawn by four elephants; and, as soon as the emperor could disengage himself from the tumult of public joy, he tasted more genuine satisfaction in the embraces of his mother and his son." --><!-- "While the emperor triumphed at Constantinople or Jerusalem, an obscure town on the confines of Syria was pillaged by the Saracens, and they cut in pieces some troops who advanced to its relief: an ordinary and trifling occurrence, had it not been the prelude of a mighty revolution. These robbers were the apostles of Mahomet; their fanatic valour had emerged from the desert; and in the last eight years of his reign Heraclius lost to the Arabs the same provinces which he had rescued from the Persians." --><!--Ηράκλειος Θριαμβευτής, 629 μ.Χ.Ο πόλεμος είχε ήδη χαθεί όταν ανέλαβε τον θρόνο,αλλά διέπλευσε τον Εύξεινο Πόντο,και επλήγωσε τους Πέρσας εις την καρδίαν της αυτοκρατορίας των.Έξι εκστρατείες, έξι θρίαμβοι—ο καθένας ενδοξότεροςτου προηγουμένου.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Lord, give me chastity and continence, but not yet! </p><p><strong>St. Augustine</strong></p></div></blockquote><p>In 1863, William Lang ran a mile in 4 minutes and 2 seconds, a record that would endure for 80 years. Standing undefeated across the decades, across two world wars, from horse and cart to television and airplanes, the record attained a mythical status. After innumerable failed attempts at breaking it, the 4 minute mile was considered impossible. Experts claimed the human heart would explode from the strain.</p><p>In 1954, Roger Bannister did what doctors had declared <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/7404?seq=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">physically impossible</a>: he ran a mile in under 4 minutes. A few weeks later the record was crushed again, and then another 46 times within just three years. </p><p>The essay you are reading right now is the four minute mile of Fucking.</p><h3 id="Monk-Life"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/02/25/the-harem-of-an-autist/#Monk-Life" class="headerlink" title="Monk Life"></a>Monk Life</h3><p>Starting in my 20s, I spent about 15 years being celibate. Not because I couldn&#39;t get laid, I just chose not to. I was more interested in reading books than chasing women. A mediocre relationship as a teenager, feeling like I had to change who I was in order to get women (and turn into something I didn&#39;t like), feeling like I was undesirable, and generally just being more interested in learning at this time led me down that path. Then one day, at 34, I got bored and suddenly decided to make Fucking my autistic special interest. Soon, I was juggling relationships with multiple women and turning down eager propositions because I had better things to do.</p><p>Of course, I had to leave some things behind. I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TelElTAONQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">betrayed the philosophical life</a>. Didn&#39;t read very much, and certainly didn&#39;t write anything. The mind atrophies as more and more blood is dedicated to engorging the penis, starving the brain of its essential nutrients and withering away its noumenal capacities.</p><p>This isn&#39;t a pickup guide. It&#39;s the story of a self-experiment. It&#39;s a case study in arbitrary limitations and choosing one&#39;s character. It&#39;s about social scripts. And it&#39;s about the discovery that what many consider to be rare and precious is actually abundant and easily accessible, if only you choose to pursue it.</p><p>People convince themselves of the absurd nonsense like &quot;I&#39;m just not good with women&quot;, &quot;I&#39;m too old to start dating seriously&quot;, &quot;I&#39;m not attractive enough for casual sex&quot;. These are nothing more than meaningless fixed ideas, and you can just wake up one day and decide to follow a different one.</p><p>Before we go further, let&#39;s establish that I&#39;m not some gigachad by nature. I&#39;m in my late 30s, tall and lean, not particularly handsome, and with the kind of light balding that says &quot;I read too much philosophy&quot;. I&#39;m a pretty good baker, I have a decent job that nobody is impressed by or interested in, and in the end I&#39;m fundamentally a weird nerd writing esoteric blog posts on the internet.</p><h3 id="What-39-s-a-Vagina"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/02/25/the-harem-of-an-autist/#What-39-s-a-Vagina" class="headerlink" title="What&#39;s a Vagina?"></a>What&#39;s a Vagina?</h3><p>So what is it like to be a manwhore? Pretty sweet, actually. (If you were wondering why I haven&#39;t written a real essay in 2 years, now you know.) But it didn&#39;t start out that way...</p><p>My approach to trying new things is to dive into the deep end of the pool and figure out if I can swim. So, naturally, the first thing I did was to buy some leather handcuffs and a wand vibrator. I took a few decent pics, created a tinder profile, and started swiping. </p><p>My first date a few days later was a cute 21 year-old Ukrainian girl. We had a quick chat on the app and I invited her out for a drink. We met up outside the metro, walked to a bar and had a pleasantly anodyne chat for about an hour or so. I did not touch her beyond an initial hug. At that point I asked her if she wanted to come back to my place; she was up to it, and we headed off. On the walk back I thought to myself: &quot;what the hell are all those people on the internet talking about? Dating is the easiest thing in the world&quot;.</p><p>She asked me about my sexual experience, especially with BDSM, but I was too insecure to tell her the truth, so I bullshitted about how some ex introduced me to the idea a couple of years ago.</p><p>We got back to my place and started making out on the couch a bit. It was at this point that ambition and reality came crashing into each other. I suddenly realized that I did not remember how any of this worked. I was basically a virgin all over again. I took her into the bedroom, but everything was <em>off</em>. I was too nervous, too eager, moving too fast. Neither of us was comfortable. I could barely get hard. Neither of us came. A disaster on every level.</p><p>I walked her down to the tram stop and never contacted her again. The embarrassment was just too bad.</p><p>The second time around was...not much better. And the third one too. Let me quote some of my dating notes from this time:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>It is probably too early to judge after 4 dating partners, but thus far the apps have brought me nothing but disappointment, pain, and anxiety. I can&#39;t even get hard for the women I sleep with. I sincerely hope there is something better down the line because otherwise I am so fucked.</p></div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Initially thought I&#39;d just fuck around, but very quickly discovered I was not built for casual sex. Don&#39;t enjoy sex all that much to begin with tbh. Can barely cum from it, when I manage to get hard! (Later note: maybe this was a bit misguided? (Later later note: it was misguided.)) [note from significantly later: casual sex is good actually]</p></div></blockquote><p>But I kept trying, figuring out what to do and what not to do, getting feedback from my partners, experimenting with all sorts of new things, and just generally getting the hang of it. About a month after starting, I met someone I became madly infatuated with, fumbled it hard, and it was all over after just 4 dates. My notes are amusing in retrospect, so earnest:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Intrusive thoughts all the time, even when I&#39;m spending intimate time with other women [...] I&#39;m terrified of doing the wrong things, being too honest or not honest enough, coming on too strong or not strong enough. I&#39;m scared that by liking you too much I&#39;m going to start repulsing you: afraid of challenging you, acting like a doormat. Nobody wants a doormat.</p></div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Went from fucking being happy all on my own to the utter bullshit of limerence, loneliness, neediness...this shit better be worth it in the long run, man.</p></div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>What if in the end our relations are the only thing that really matters, and it&#39;s too late for me? What if I&#39;m totally fucked?</p></div></blockquote><p>That was my first inkling that I really wanted something more than just casual sex, but I also felt the need to explore more before trying to settle down.</p><p>I had grown up on a steady diet of third-hand dating wisdom: I needed to act like a douche, develop &quot;game,&quot; become some sort of Alpha Chad. Early on, dating felt like a rollercoaster partly because I was not really secure in myself. A week without any matches would feel depressing, a week with multiple dates would make me feel like I was on top of the world. Fundamentally the issue was that I was looking for external validation and trying to protect or build up a fragile ego.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>So easy to get discouraged, even when things are going relatively well, I&#39;m banging multiple women, etc. One failure and I&#39;m feeling bad ffs.</p></div></blockquote><p>What took a while to figure out was that being a weirdo worked just fine. More than &quot;just fine&quot;, it was the right thing to do, because that&#39;s the only way you can attract people who are really into <em>you</em>. Breaking through the initial pain and anxiety was crucial though, I think it&#39;s easy to get caught in a cycle of low self-esteem, failing to improve, and self-sabotaging, which just causes more low self-esteem. But I just picked up the pieces, kept learning, and kept going. I tried to embrace rejection: fear of rejection is paralyzing, yet actual rejection gives clarity, courage, and finality. The absurd thing is that even after dozens of rejections, the fear never gets easier. The lesson seems impossible to internalize—maybe I needed more repetitions? Should&#39;ve done 5x5 rejections twice a week like some kind of twisted gym routine?</p><h3 id="The-Harem-of-an-Autist"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/02/25/the-harem-of-an-autist/#The-Harem-of-an-Autist" class="headerlink" title="The Harem of an Autist"></a>The Harem of an Autist</h3><p>Between August 2022 and June 2024 I went on 36 first dates with women of 26 different ethnicities. I slept with 17 of them, and had steady relationships with 7. From portfolio managers to women with shaved heads and dagger tattoos on their chest, I was mostly drawn to the &quot;art hoes&quot;.</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/arthoe.png" title="art hoe definition." alt="I don&apos;t play guitar or skate."><span class="image-caption">I don&apos;t play guitar or skate.</span><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It didn&#39;t take long for me to figure out what to do in bed. Six months after my first date, one of my friends with benefits used the words &quot;transcendent&quot; and &quot;I felt something die in me&quot; to describe our night together. But my brain was busy cataloguing her self-absorption and being bored.</p><p>A curious thing I noticed was that many of the women I dated weren&#39;t actually seeing other guys on the side. Some were uninterested, unwilling to put in the effort, while some (even really cute girls) seemed to have trouble finding even someone willing to bang them. So I found myself in a weird harem situation, dating 3-4 women at a time, having threesomes and generally living a life of debauchery. My calendar looked like a messy game of Tetris.</p><p>This is the timeline of all my dates/relationships (blue: had sex; red: no sex):</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/dating_gantt.jpg" title="gantt chart" alt="Nothing says &apos;catch&apos; like a man who Gantt-charts his dating history."><span class="image-caption">Nothing says &apos;catch&apos; like a man who Gantt-charts his dating history.</span><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The reality of being a &quot;player&quot; was not always what I had imagined it to be though. Take Alice, for example: she was kind of a hopeless romantic who had spent a decade pining over her ex. Three dates in, she was clearly falling for me harder than I was for her. She was lovely: beautiful, intelligent, great in bed, had her shit together. She wrote me poems. We even lived together for a couple of months. And yet for some reason beyond my understanding, I felt an emotional distance that could not be overcome. I think on some subconscious level I was getting off on making her fall for me even more, but the screwed up power dynamic just gave me a hollow feeling. I almost stopped reading during my relationship with her, and my creativity died completelyal. I realized that I needed something different out of my partner, something with more intensity, even if it means having to go through more turbulence. Alice thought we&#39;d date for a year and amicably go our separate ways, and that&#39;s what happened in the end.</p><p>Having women compete for your attention, maintaining multiple relationships, the power to say &quot;no&quot;—it pumps up your ego in a way that feels amazing at first but eventually reveals itself to be a bit empty. You end up creating these parallel lives, each relationship its own little universe that never quite achieves escape velocity. Sometimes that&#39;s exactly what you want. But it gets old.</p><p>In the midst of all this, I met some truly remarkable people. Despite things not working out romantically in the long run, I&#39;m genuinely grateful for their presence in my life. I don&#39;t think failed relationships are a waste of time, not every connection needs to last forever to be meaningful. Some people are just passing through your life, leaving it better than they found it. And hopefully you leave them better than you found them. I also fucked up, more than once. I hurt people who didn&#39;t deserve it—made promises I didn&#39;t keep, acted in ways that I&#39;m not proud of. Sometimes other people had to pay the price of my learning curve.</p><p>The one thing I was consistent about was being radically open and honest about everything, including seeing other people. Every time I tried to be &quot;strategic&quot; it backfired spectacularly. The whole pickup artist mythology about being a manipulative seductor is complete bullshit.</p><p><strong>The Dating</strong></p><p>Sex is easy to get in enormous quantities; finding someone you actually <em>like</em> is basically impossible. In the end, the game is probabilistic—you have to keep trying, keep meeting people, keep rolling the dice until you find something real. The scariest thing is that compatibility is mostly ineffable. The evidence collected <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6yiayg5QWtWme4JN8/anatomy-of-a-dating-document?commentId=ctD7rHdPpwdSW8jMt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by gwern</a> is extremely interesting, and basically boils down to this: it&#39;s impossible to predict a couple&#39;s romantic success based on their explicit characteristics. Understanding this also helped me understand why the relationship with Alice didn&#39;t work out. The best you can do is try to minimize false negatives by letting go of your preconceptions and dating broadly.</p><p>That said, I found myself drawn to women who were independent, challenging, intelligent, creative, and unapologetically weird,  the ones who weren&#39;t entirely sane but were intensely curious about the world. Other than lack of physical attraction, the most typical reason I would reject someone was &quot;they&#39;re boring&quot;—after spending years hanging out with 155 IQ schizophrenic metapolitical anarchomonarchists on the internet, conversation with normal people can start to feel a bit plain.</p><p>More on this in a future essay.</p><h4 id="The-Sex"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/02/25/the-harem-of-an-autist/#The-Sex" class="headerlink" title="The Sex"></a>The Sex</h4><p>Great sex comes from the same place as great relationships: openness, honesty, and genuine confidence. When you&#39;re comfortable with yourself and actually give a fuck about your partner&#39;s pleasure, spectacular things can happen. Sometimes your partners will orgasm so hard they start crying, and that&#39;s a good thing.</p><p>Just as runners for decades believed breaking that barrier was physically impossible, most people have convinced themselves that transcendent sex is out of reach, that &quot;good enough&quot; is the best they can hope for. They&#39;ve internalized stories about how men are just naturally bad at sex, how women are difficult to please, how great sexual chemistry is rare and magical rather than just a learnable skill. But mastering this skill means leaving your ego at the door.</p><p>The truth is this: the bar for men is on the fucking floor. The vast majority of guys are absolutely terrible at sex, to a degree that is almost unbelievable. I met multiple beautiful women with bodycounts in the dozens who had essentially never had good sex in their lives before meeting me. Not because I&#39;m some magical sex god, but simply because I gave a damn and put some passion into it.</p><p>A strange realization: I have vastly <a href="https://x.com/Aella_Girl/status/1874602104972828920" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more sex than Aella</a>, who is famous for being a whore. If even <em>Aella</em> isn&#39;t getting laid enough, what hope is there for normal people? How do we <em>increase the fuck rate</em> for the masses? I think the answer is depressingly simple: most people don&#39;t have more sex because the sex they do have is mediocre at best. They settle for &quot;good enough&quot; and stop looking for better, stop trying to <em>be</em> better. It&#39;s like someone declaring they don&#39;t like sushi after only eating gas station California rolls. So, to answer <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2005/05/why_dont_people.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tyler&#39;s question</a>: people don&#39;t have more sex because most sex is lame.</p><p>More on this, too, in a future essay.</p><h3 id="Imaginary-Barriers"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/02/25/the-harem-of-an-autist/#Imaginary-Barriers" class="headerlink" title="Imaginary Barriers"></a>Imaginary Barriers</h3><p><strong>Nice guys:</strong> a lot of people think you need to be a jerk to get laid, but that&#39;s just another fake social script. The truth is this: being &quot;nice&quot; from a position of weakness is dating kryptonite. Women can smell the desperation. But being genuinely kind from a position of confidence and abundance is incredibly attractive. The difference isn&#39;t in the behavior itself, but in the energy behind it. True kindness flows from having clear boundaries and standards, from being genuinely interested in someone&#39;s wellbeing and pleasure—not from being a pushover hoping to trade basic decency for sexual access.</p><p><strong>The power to say no:</strong> </p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/eigenrobot/status/1744415149983690876" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/eigen_sayingno.png" class="nofancybox"></a></p><p>One of the most liberating discoveries wasn&#39;t the sex, but realizing I could...say no to it. At some point I started waiting for the second date before getting physical—the connection was better, the sex more comfortable. But it resulted in the strange scenario of girls practically pleading to come back to my place on first dates. Women find it bizarre when you say &quot;no&quot; in that situation, it&#39;s just not in their script. They&#39;re so accustomed to men desperate to get their dick wet that when you flip the dynamic, it short-circuits their entire understanding of dating. </p><p>This whole pathetic dance of men begging for a crumb of sex, trying to push the girl to come back to his place while she resists and acts as a gatekeeper to sex, etc.—it&#39;s entirely a choice. A collective delusion that persists only because everyone keeps playing their assigned role. You can simply reject it.</p><p><strong>Abundance mindset:</strong> when I had 2-3 concurrent partners, I became extremely selective and rejected almost everyone I went out with. The psychological impact of abundance is to make you secure in your own judgments, to push up your standards to where they should be in the first place and stick with them. Scarcity creates artificial commitment to bad relationships. Abundance helps you realize that compatible partners aren&#39;t unicorns—they&#39;re just people you haven&#39;t met yet. And entering a serious relationship with the perspective and attitude that abundance bestows on you makes everything so much easier.</p><p><strong>Cold approach:</strong> the barrier I have not broken yet. I&#39;m too fucking terrified to cold approach women in public, yet at the same time, I&#39;ve had way more sex than friends who regularly chat up strangers. A friend casually mentioned hitting on a cute girl in a museum, talking to her for an hour, and then bailing unceremoniously, not knowing how to close the deal. The very thought of hitting on a stranger makes me sink into the floor, melting through the boards, my liquefied body dripping right into the third circle of Dante&#39;s hell, but I have infinitely (literally, divided by zero) more sex than he did at the time. This makes absolutely no sense and completely contradicts conventional wisdom about &quot;getting out there&quot;.</p><h3 id="Finding-Fluorescence"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/02/25/the-harem-of-an-autist/#Finding-Fluorescence" class="headerlink" title="Finding Fluorescence"></a>Finding Fluorescence</h3><p>Once sex becomes easy, it loses some of its mystique. I found myself having as much sex as I wanted, but it was a fleeting satisfaction that left me yearning for more. One of the notes in my dating journal, following a breakup, reads:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>All I&#39;m left with is a nostalgic longing for a future that never was.  </p></div></blockquote><p>Maybe that&#39;s not such a bad thing. Getting your heart stomped when someone doesn&#39;t reciprocate your feelings is a special kind of hell, but it turned out to be a necessary step.</p><p>Last year, I wrote to myself:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>I&#39;m not looking for someone who ticks my boxes. I&#39;m after &quot;I can&#39;t believe you exist&quot;, I want to be amazed, I am after fluorescent effervescence and electric bolts running up my spine, I want to feel like I&#39;m on amphetamines 24/7, entirely incapable of sleeping, lose my job and end up in an early grave because of my romantic obsession.</p></div></blockquote><p>Perhaps my relationship standards had been set by reading too many Russian novels, but then, improbably, unbelievably, astonishingly, I found her! And while boatloads of casual sex was pretty damn good, it doesn&#39;t hold a candle to settling down in a loving, inspiring relationship with a fantastic partner.</p><p>But here&#39;s the thing: I don&#39;t think I could have found it, or been ready for it, without all the fucking around first. The experience, the confidence that comes from abundance, from knowing you can walk away, from having your pick of partners—it fundamentally changes how you interact with the world. Without experiencing the wrong relationships—the boring ones, the sexually charged but emotionally empty ones, the ones where you&#39;re more therapist than partner—you lack the contrast needed to recognize something extraordinary when it does appear.</p><p>This stuff often fucking hurts. There&#39;s a reason the Buddha thought desire was the root of all suffering. But you know what? <a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/02/03/the-alchemist-and-his-quicksilver/">Fuck the Buddha</a>. Some pain is worth having.</p><p>Sometimes I wonder if getting into all this so late in life was a mistake. Did those years of celibacy permanently rewire my brain? Did I miss some crucial developmental window? A <a href="https://twitter.com/alexeyguzey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">friend of mine</a> said that celibacy has already destroyed my psyche. But I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true, it&#39;s never too late to fall in love.</p><p>So, what&#39;s next? Back to the books, or happy-ever-after relationship wireheading? One thing about breaking through arbitrary limitations is that it leaves you facing real ones, like how to spend the few days you have left on the planet. Nobody knows what the future holds, but I&#39;m really happy with my life right now.</p><p><strong>Fin</strong></p><p>We&#39;re all role-playing, and most people don&#39;t realize that they can just switch roles. You can just choose to be whatever you want. You Can Just Do Stuff™. So here&#39;s the four-minute mile of Fucking: if you&#39;re a reasonably put-together guy in his mid-30s, you could be having threesomes with cute college students. You simply have to make the choice to do it, the barriers are all inside you. If you&#39;re actually handsome or successful, you can basically live like Leo in perpetuity, though you&#39;ll probably get bored of it faster than he does. </p><p>But even if that&#39;s not what you want, I still recommend making sex <em>your</em> autistic special interest for a year or two. Not just for the obvious benefits, but because it opens up new mental and emotional states, teaches you surprising things about how people work, and most importantly, lets you enter a serious relationship knowing exactly what you want and what you&#39;re worth. And then you can make an informed decision: do I want to go monk mode, or full Simon Sarris? (Those are the only legitimate options).</p><!-- Tweet: In my latest post I tell the story of how I went from 15 years of celibacy to being a bigger slut than Aella.After 15 years of celibacy, I decided to make sex my autistic special interest.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>To burn always with this hard, gemlike flame, to maintain this ecstasy, is success in life.</p></div></blockquote><p>We are going around the table on new year&#39;s eve, rating our past year on a scale of 1 to 10. The guests: artists, fashion designers, jewelers, and one or two people with real jobs sprinkled in for diversity. Two immaculately groomed poodles run around and entertain the visitors. Before us, an exactingly curated procession of morsels: blini with salmon and caviar, black brioche with cured egg yolk and parmigiano foam, ravioli with pumpkin and cod with browned butter and crispy sage. The apartment, naturally, is luxurious without being gauche (that would be unforgivable) every piece selected with impeccable taste and just the right amount of personal touch. And so we rate our years, the numbers start coming out, and it is a parade of 2s and 3s, each delivered with a sort of practiced <em>weltschmerz</em>. One of the guests plans to commit suicide soon. The only 10 in the room: me. Is it because I&#39;ve been perfectly happy, carefree? No—not quite.</p><p>I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about this lately, about my relationship with suffering. All this pain in the past few months, I think most people would recoil from it. Instead, I&#39;m drawn towards it. Is it psychological masochism? The intensity of emotion—it makes me feel alive, present, it gives me a heightened awareness of everything, inside and out. </p><p>I compulsively play with the pain in my mind: my thoughts trace its edges like fingers mapping an unknown shape in the dark; I run my mind over its surface to feel its texture, sometimes sharpcutting, sometimes soft and dull; I press against it, and see how it reacts; I savor it, let it melt in my mouth and glory in its bitterness; I feel the heat radiating from it like the dying embers of a fire late at night, and other times like x-rays blasting out of a black hole; I spin it around examining it from each and every angle one by one, appreciating its style from every point of view; I push it far away and look at it with a telescope to admire its entire structure, and then bring it right up to me and inspect every microscopic little element on its surface, and then sometimes I dive in and give myself over to it and let it envelop me and permeate my whole being until I feel and perceive nothing else and time stops completely. </p><p>(And sometimes I will take a good look at myself as though I were a case study: &quot;Subject displays strong tendencies toward self-dramatization, perpetually overthinking and rationalizing their emotions through baroque metaphors.&quot;)</p><p>I am even amused and entertained by it. I laugh at my life and these surprising and delightful and wretchedly dark alleyways it&#39;s leading me down. A dull psychiatrist would say it&#39;s nothing more than a defense mechanism. I don&#39;t believe that at all. This is not about protecting myself or &quot;processing&quot;. It&#39;s &quot;saying Yes to life even in its strangest and hardest problems&quot;—not to be liberated from terror and pity, but &quot;in order to be oneself the eternal joy of becoming&quot;. There is a kind of distance there, but it&#39;s not a detachment, it is rather a doubling of perception. It&#39;s a way of transmuting things. It&#39;s not that the pain becomes less real or less painful—it becomes <em>more</em> real, <em>more</em> vibrant, <em>more</em> itself—but it also becomes something else simultaneously. </p><p>To treat reality as a medium, to live life with the texture of a novel—this is part of the bargain of being me: simultaneously the author and his character. The paradox: rather than dulling your emotions, this splitting of consciousness instead makes everything more vivid. Like adding a mirror to a mirror and creating—infinity. When you view yourself from the third person, as someone whose life you are sketching out, every powerful emotion is a delight. And it&#39;s not just pain that works this way—joy, too, takes on this double character, I&#39;m swept up in it while also watching myself being swept up, and somehow the watching makes the feeling more intense rather than less. I am both the alchemist and his quicksilver, the sculptor and the clay, <a href="https://img.rss.com/the-antifada/800/cover_af0cba9447ae436aa637d6450bacb33d.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>creature and creator</em></a>.</p><p>I love my life — <em>aesthetically</em>.</p><p>It&#39;s not a mechanical collecting of experiences to dissect on a couch or on the page. Baudelaire writes of the artist-dandy as &quot;a man possessing at every moment the genius of childhood, in other words a genius for whom no edge of life is blunted.&quot; Not &quot;making meaning&quot; after the fact, but in the experience of every moment. A perpetual state of creative tension, of <em>becoming</em> and <em>self-overcoming</em>.</p><p>That is―<em>Anti-Buddhism</em>. Self-examination not to feel less, but to feel <em>more</em>. Not to avoid suffering, but to <em>glory in life</em>. Not to detach but to <em>overcome</em>. Not to escape, but to <em>revel</em> in life! Not to transcend, but to <em>heighten</em>. Cultivating not detachment, but <em>intensity</em> and <em>sensitivity</em>, with a poet&#39;s intentionality, making the self into an artist in the joy of its own eternal becoming. Creating a layer of aesthetic appreciation that runs parallel to the raw experience, and shapes it. Saying <em>No!</em> to the inhuman, life-denying ascetic nihilism of seeking &quot;liberation&quot; from attachment and suffering, <em>No!</em> to the <a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2022/10/10/against-effective-altruism/"><em>naiveties about pleasure and pain</em></a> that constitute this intellectual morass that surrounds us.</p><p>Everywhere people seek to smooth life&#39;s edges. Instead of riding its violent waves, they seek to transform them into a tepid swimming pool suitable for gentle laps without the least chance of drowning. They cling desperately onto old religions when they talk about enlightenment but mean only quietude, when they preach transcendence but mean only escape. What petty bargains with existence! This is not wisdom, but cowardice masquerading as enlightenment. They seek to tame, diminish, and bridle everything that should be wild! What is this if not a rejection of life itself? Life, which knows nothing of balance but only of tension, nothing of peace but only of creative strife! What sickness entices you to paddle in the shallows instead of making infinite demands on life and always finding yourself in some new wilderness? For &quot;life consists with wildness, and the most alive is the wildest.&quot;</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>The discipline of suffering, of <em>great</em> suffering – do you not know that it is <em>this</em> discipline alone which has created every elevation of mankind hitherto? That tension of the soul in misfortune which cultivates its strength, its terror at the sight of great destruction, its inventiveness and bravery in undergoing, enduring, interpreting, exploiting misfortune, and whatever of depth, mystery, mask, spirit, cunning and greatness has been bestowed upon it – has it not been bestowed through suffering, through the discipline of great suffering?</p></div></blockquote><p>I used to view the <em>tortured artist</em> with both envy and skepticism. It was a Romantic idea that I thought I wanted, while at the same time dismissing it as an affectation, a trope, a false source of inspiration, or perhaps just a tool to seduce women with. Sour grapes, I suppose. Now I have become him (inadvertently? or by design?) and the view from the inside is not quite what I was expecting...it is both more silly and more real than I thought it&#39;d be. There is certainly an absurd theater to it all. But the authenticity lies precisely in embracing the sublime <em>and</em> the ridiculous, in realizing that the real thing is both more serious and more playful than the cliché suggests. But it&#39;s not about turning pain into art, it&#39;s this splitting of consciousness that makes the darkest moments shimmer with beauty. Pain is not raw material to be processed later—it&#39;s already art in the moment of perception, if you&#39;ve developed the right kind of vision. &quot;Art from pain&quot; is shallow, I am talking about a methodology of life and consciousness: <em>Amor fati</em>! </p><p><em>The great sickness of our age</em>: the belief that life is something to be managed rather than a drama to be enacted. </p><p>Anyway, this is all a bit melodramatic if not pretentious...</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>—A wonderful piece.</p><!--As Hugo says, we are all sentenced to death with an indefinite reprieve. Make the most of what little time we have!--><!--why the lucky stiff:[on kafka asking max brod to burn his papers]:This was just Kafka, writing his own death. This ending has his signature on it. Reality's kind of a medium, maybe greater than paper. We all want life to have the same texture that we read about in novels.--><!--Stirner:> I do not assume myself, because in each moment I am really setting up or creating myself for the first time, and am only I, not by being assumed, but by being set up, and again set up only in the moment when I set myself up; i.e., I am creator and creature in one. -- *The Unique and Its Property*, 1.3.4. Postscript--><!--Pater:> The service of philosophy, of speculative culture, towards the human spirit is to rouse, to startle it into sharp and eager observation. Every moment some form grows perfect in hand or face; some tone on the hills or the sea is choicer than the rest; some mood of passion or insight or intellectual excitement is irresistibly real and attractive for us,—for that moment only. Not the fruit of experience, but experience itself, is the end. A counted number of pulses only is given to us of a variegated, dramatic life. How may we see in them all that is to be seen in them by the finest senses? How shall we pass most swiftly from point to point, and be present always at the focus where the greatest number of vital forces unite in their purest energy? > To burn always with this hard, gemlike flame, to maintain this ecstasy, is success in life. In a sense it might even be said that our failure is to form habits: for, after all, habit is relative to a stereotyped world, and meantime it is only the roughness of the eye that makes any two persons, things, situations, seem alike. While all melts under our feet, we may well catch at any exquisite passion, or any contribution to knowledge that seems by a lifted horizon to set the spirit free for a moment, or any stirring of the senses, strange dyes, strange colours, and curious odours, or work of the artist's hands, or the face of one's friend. Not to discriminate every moment some passionate attitude in those about us, and in the brilliancy of their gifts some tragic dividing of forces on their ways, is, on this short day of frost and sun, to sleep before evening. With this sense of the splendour of our experience and of its awful brevity, gathering all we are into one desperate effort to see and touch, we shall hardly have time to make theories about the things we see and touch.> Well! we are all condamnes, as Victor Hugo says: we are all under sentence of death but with a sort of indefinite reprieve—les hommes sont tous condamnes a mort avec des sursis indefinis: we have an interval, and then our place knows us no more. Some spend this interval in listlessness, some in high passions, the wisest, at least among "the children of this world," in art and song. For our one chance lies in expanding that interval, in getting as many pulsations as possible into the given time. Great passions may give us this quickened sense of life, ecstasy and sorrow of love, the various forms of enthusiastic activity, disinterested or otherwise, which come naturally to many of us. Only be sure it is passion—that it does yield you this fruit of a quickened, multiplied consciousness. Of this wisdom, the poetic passion, the desire of beauty, the love of art for art's sake, has most; for art comes to you professing frankly to give nothing but the highest quality to your moments as they pass, and simply for those moments' sake.--><!--BGE225:> Whether it be hedonism or pessimism or utilitarianism or eudaemonism: all these modes of thought which assess the value of things according to *pleasure* and *pain*, that is to say according to attendant and secondary phenomena, are foreground modes of thought and naïveties which anyone conscious of *creative* powers and an artist's conscience will look down on with derision, though not without pity. Pity for *you*! That, to be sure, is not pity for social ‘distress’, for ‘society’ and its sick and unfortunate, for the vicious and broken from the start who lie all around us; even less is it pity for the grumbling, oppressed, rebellious slave classes who aspire after domination – they call it ‘freedom’. *Our* pity is a more elevated, more farsighted pity – we see how *man* is diminishing himself, how *you* are diminishing him! – and there are times when we behold *your* pity with an indescribable anxiety, when we defend ourselves against this pity – when we find your seriousness more dangerous than any kind of frivolity. You want if possible – and there is no madder ‘if possible’ – *to abolish suffering*; and we? – it really does seem that we would rather increase it and make it worse than it has ever been! Wellbeing as you understand it – that is no goal, that seems to us an *end*! A state which soon renders man ludicrous and contemptible – which makes it *desirable* that he should perish! The discipline of suffering, of *great* suffering – do you not know that it is *this* discipline alone which has created every elevation of mankind hitherto? That tension of the soul in misfortune which cultivates its strength, its terror at the sight of great destruction, its inventiveness and bravery in undergoing, enduring, interpreting, exploiting misfortune, and whatever of depth, mystery, mask, spirit, cunning and greatness has been bestowed upon it – has it not been bestowed through suffering, through the discipline of great suffering? In man, *creature* and *creator* are united: in man there is matter, fragment, excess, clay, mud, madness, chaos; but in man there is also creator, sculptor, the hardness of the hammer, the divine spectator and the seventh day – do you understand this antithesis? And that *your* pity is for the ‘creature in man’, for that which has to be formed, broken, forged, torn, burned, annealed, refined – that which has to *suffer* and *should* suffer? And *our* pity – do you not grasp whom our *opposite* pity is for when it defends itself against your pity as the worst of all pampering and weakening? – Pity *against* pity, then! – But, to repeat, there are higher problems than the problems of pleasure and pain and pity; and every philosophy that treats only of them is a piece of naïvety. -Amor fati:> My formula for greatness in a human being is amor fati: that one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity. Not merely bear what is necessary, still less conceal it—all idealism is mendaciousness in the face of what is necessary—but love itSaying Yes to Life (Twilight of the Idols):> **Saying Yes to life even in its strangest and hardest problems**, the will to life rejoicing over its own inexhaustibility even in the very sacrifice of its highest types--that is what I called Dionysian, that is what I guessed to be the bridge to the psychology of the tragic poet. **Not in order to be liberated from terror and pity, not in order to purge oneself of a dangerous affect by its vehement discharge--Aristotle understood it that way--but in order to be oneself the eternal joy of becoming**, beyond all terror and pity--that joy which included even joy in destroying.To give style to one's character:> To "give style" to one's character - that is a grand and a rare art! He who surveys all that his nature presents in its strength and in its weakness, and then fashions it into an ingenious plan, until everything appears artistic and rational, and even the weaknesses enchant the eye - he exercises that admirable art. Here there has been a great amount of second nature added, there a portion of first nature has been taken away: - in both cases with long exercise and daily labour at the task. Here the ugly, which does not permit of being taken away, has been concealed, there it has been re-interpreted into the sublime. Much of the vague, which refuses to take form, has been reserved and utilised for the perspectives: - it is meant to give a hint of the remote and immeasurable. In the end, when the work has been completed, it is revealed how it was the constraint of the same taste that organised and fashioned it in whole and in part: whether the taste was good or bad is of less importance than one thinks, - it is sufficient that it was a single taste!Intervals and intermissions:> Love, springtime, every beautiful melody, mountains, the moon, the sea – all these speak completely to the heart but once, if in fact they ever do get a chance to speak completely. For many men do not have those moments at all, and are themselves intervals and intermissions in the symphony of real life.--><!--Baudelaire, the painter of modern life:>I was asking you just now to think of M. G. as an eternal convalescent; to complete your idea of>him, think of him also as a man-child, as a man possessing at every moment the genius of>childhood, in other words a genius for whom no edge of life is blunted.--><!--Thoreau:> Life consists with wildness. The most alive is the wildest. Not yet subdued to man, its presence refreshes him. One who pressed forward incessantly and never rested from his labors, who grew fast and made infinite demands on life, would always find himself in a new country or wilderness, and surrounded by the raw material of life.> It is remarkable how few events or crises there are in our histories, how little exercised we have been in our minds, how few experiences we have had. I would fain be assured that I am growing apace and rankly, though my very growth disturb this dull equanimity—though it be with struggle through long, dark, muggy nights or seasons of gloom. It would be well if all our lives were a divine tragedy even, instead of this trivial comedy or farce. Dante, Bunyan, and others appear to have been exercised in their minds more than we> My desire for knowledge is intermittent, but my desire to bathe my head in atmospheres unknown to my feet is perennial and constant.> Above all, we cannot afford not to live in the present. --><!--Emerson:> Man is timid and apologetic; he is no longer upright; he dares not say 'I think,' 'I am,' but quotes some saint or sage. He is ashamed before the blade of grass or the blowing rose. These roses under my window make no reference to former roses or to better ones; they are for what they are; they exist with God to-day. There is no time to them. There is simply the rose; it is perfect in every moment of its existence. Before a leaf-bud has burst, its whole life acts; in the full-blown flower there is no more; in the leafless root there is no less. Its nature is satisfied, and it satisfies nature, in all moments alike. But man postpones or remembers; he does not live in the present, but with reverted eye laments the past, or, heedless of the riches that surround him, stands on tiptoe to foresee the future.--><div class="subscribediv" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:250px;margin-top:30px;"><form class="validate" action="https://fantasticanachronism.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=2a6ff66ec7039625cb12680d5&amp;amp;id=f713c1306c" method="post" id="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" target="_blank"><div class="mc-field-group"><input class="required email" type="email" name="EMAIL" id="mce-EMAIL" placeholder="Type your email..." value></div><div class="clear" id="mce-responses"><div class="respose" id="mce-error-response" style="display:none"></div><div class="respose" id="mce-success-response" style="display:none"></div></div><div style="position: absolute; left: -5000px" aria-hidden="true"><input type="text" name="b_2a6ff66ec7039625cb12680d5_f713c1306c" tabindex="-1" value></div><div class="clear"><input type="submit" value="Subscribe" name="subscribe" id="mc-embedded-subscribe" clas="button"></div></form></div>]]></content>

People protest against death and have sex while levitating in the air, abandoned factories hide fantastical secrets. About writing, literature, art, humanity, dreams, death, life, love, bureaucracy. Nihilism and its defeat. Very wide array of influences, including H. P. Lovecraft, Jorge Luis Borges, all the Latin American magical realists as well as Bulgakov, Bolano, Pynchon, Dylan Thomas, Franz Kafka, even Cronenberg.</p><br><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>We search like idiots, we look in places where there is nothing to find, like spiders that weave webs in the corner of a bathroom where flies don’t come, where not even mosquitos can reach. We shrivel in our webs by the thousands, but what doesn’t die is our need for truth. We are like people drawn inside of a square on a piece of paper. We cannot get out of the black lines, we exhaust ourselves by examining, dozens and hundreds of times, every part of the square, hoping to find a fissure. Until one of us suddenly understands, because he was predestined to understand, that within the plane of the paper escape is impossible. That the exit, simple and open wide, is perpendicular to the paper, in a third dimension that up until that moment was inconceivable. Such that, to the amazement of those still inside the four ink lines, the chosen one breaks out of his chrysalis, spreads his enormous wings, and rises gently, leaving his shadow below in his former world. </p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both;"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/bb24_mediterranean.jpg" class="floatright nofancybox"><p>Fernand Braudel, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mediterranean-World-Age-Philip-II/dp/0520400658?crid=2EMWJ2OXH68D7&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Yw3ePswU37kOCDJgVvS8ubVk0S8flb_nAbidHP4ycjYgvWP3zwB-_cobfdEUrwCBqPkGY66xnbxH5j3dPcoVA-YMih4HemrJK3_sgwiksXG9whGUOrNe4Cwi5zvMiZexfJ3sAGI3u35hk855v-nMLLR1Jc_INg5G0kvnBMG5I4Wy3MyppGgdDjn2XfLUxQNgzIPiANt8l_a3z7nqJq7Nrda_vE_P6BCAVkyx_zz6MFo.jheeAPci-J4TzJWV1349SxIjij4PWhUi0475TyvNk98&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Mediterranean+and+the+Mediterranean+World+in+the+Age+of+Philip+II&qid=1737661639&sprefix=the+mediterranean+and+the+mediterranean+world+in+the+age+of+philip+ii%2Caps%2C392&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=4da162574e27eeed549ee787a5ba896a&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II</strong></a></p><p>Not quite as strong as Civilization &amp; Capitalism, but it&#39;s a brilliant work, the result of decades of painstaking research. The Braudelian world-view is felt on every page, the interlocking systems of trade, production, geography, crops, animals and people. Mountains shape trade routes, climate patterns determine harvests, sea currents guide merchants - everything connects to everything else in Braudel&#39;s Mediterranean. Written in a Nazi POW camp, it brought a fresh perspective on how to think about history: not kings and battles, but the slow dance of geography and climate, the rhythms of peasant life, the endless circulation of ships and goods. Immensely ambitious and beautifully written.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>But we cannot hope for precise measurements; at most we shall discover an order of magnitude. In this respect the Mediterranean was still broadly speaking the same size in the sixteenth century as it had been in Roman times, that is, over a thousand years earlier. Or to put it another way, the Mediterranean in the sixteenth century was comparable, mutatis mutandis, to the entire globe in 1939. It was vast, immeasurable, and its reputation as a &#39;human&#39; area was earned only by contrast with those other monsters which sixteenth-century man was just beginning to tackle - the Atlantic Ocean, not to mention the Pacific. These were truly monsters, alongside which the Mediterranean was more like a domestic animal, but certainly not the &#39;lake&#39; it has become in the twentieth century, the sunny resort of tourists and yachts where one can always reach land within a few hours and along whose length the traveller could be transported in the Orient Express. To understand what it was like in the sixteenth century, one must mentally magnify its area to a maximum and draw on remembered images from travellers&#39; tales of the days when months, years, even a whole lifetime, could be spent on a voyage.</p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both;"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/bb24_suttree.jpg" class="floatleft nofancybox"><p>Cormac McCarthy, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Suttree-Cormac-McCarthy/dp/0679736328?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.oosrep83q9Uudok2J2r8OpEu3xjehAzasMW-EnoD3p6gZ_qhNODqHyAnRCpsd75JJtt1aSnhNhhVNuFfhAEW12u7Zi8YF71its9-9IOmmDsi-rAUwvsuSMjs8PKhgY_pCTFNsV5U2qlvUH9IYhOHy7al7s_Jc9snaaq0Z22OF_9JHdwCKPnckO2c9uE5ziu4DI4FJGUBvlxcpvmbTfeQhHpd4raxwNu2UOWDnF67oB8.vq0Ck12z-3I4O9X7koNc9DXp8nHjqFEb_366VwR0Phk&dib_tag=se&keywords=Suttree&qid=1737661670&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=2ce749dbcf217d327313ab3bdbf1b686&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Suttree</strong></a></p><p>Basically nothing happens in this book, and it is absolutely spectacular.

It doesn&#39;t focus strongly on the science, more on the person and his relations, and the recurring theme is one of petty resentment and inability to understand von Neumann because he was simply so far above and ahead of everyone else around him. The resentment often manifests as a kind of petty moralism, and Labatut basically makes everyone in von Neumann&#39;s life look rather pathetic. I don&#39;t know how factual that is, but it certainly works as a literary device.</p><p>The second part concerns Lee Sedol and AlphaGo. It&#39;s a bit drawn out, but it&#39;s an exciting story that&#39;s well-told. The point is essentially to underscore just how much von Neumann could see 60+ years ago, when everyone around him was essentially blind. AlphaGo is to the greatest humans as von Neumann is to normal ones -- we should expect the relations to play out in a similar way in both cases.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>I have known a great many intelligent people in my life. I knew Planck, von Laue, and Heisenberg. Paul Dirac was my brother-in-law, Leo Szilard and Edward Teller have been among my closest friends, and Albert Einstein was a good friend too.

Raw, intimate, with complete lack of dignity, it felt like an invasion of her privacy. Living life novelistically. How lovers really only exist in our minds. I think the essential, unique part of the story is that there is no attempt at justification, explanation, etc. She accepts and presents the bare facts about herself, and almost nothing about her lover. In a way this is a portrayal of incredibly deep passion, on the other hand her approach also makes it feel really shallow: he&#39;s handsome, drives a fast car, career-minded. We have absolutely no clue what her passion is for exactly, but that&#39;s exactly the point, that the reason of the passion is irrelevant or unknowable or inexplicable or not worth explaining, what really matters is her own experience and what she takes from it (&quot;I do not wish to explain my passion—that would imply that it was a mistake or some disorder I need to justify—I just want to describe it.&quot; and &quot;Whether or not he was “worth it” is of no consequence.&quot;) She considers herself luckier than him because she has the obsession and he does not, that really stood out as the cornerstone of the whole thing.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>When he rang to arrange a meeting, his long-awaited call had no effect on me and I remained locked in the same state of anxiety as before. My condition was such that not even the sound of his voice could make me happy. It was all infinite emptiness, except when we were together making love. And even then I dreaded the moments to come, when he would be gone. I experienced pleasure like a future pain. I longed to end the affair, so as not to be at the mercy of a phone call, so as not to suffer, realizing at once what this would entail, seconds after the separation: a series of days with nothing to wait for. I preferred to carry on at any cost—let him have another woman, or even several. (In other words, accepting a torment far greater than the one that made me want to leave him.) Compared to such emptiness, my present situation seemed enviable and my jealousy a sort of frail privilege which I would have been mad to want to end since one day it would end anyway, outside my control, when he would leave the country or would decide to stop seeing me.</p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both;"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/bb24_fragnemt.jpg" class="floatleft nofancybox"><p>Ctrlcreep, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fragnemt-ctrlcreep/dp/1795354437?crid=9HSHCLOGZPG2&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Prk6XNrVplhXtvdiykMQ6Q._KWCiiz9KrSwxp3T1Qk8kJ54JmaUVbMNXX05aWMRWQo&dib_tag=se&keywords=ctrl+creep&qid=1737661859&sprefix=ctrlcre%2Caps%2C184&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=f52f2f60f2d0f4552eedfe9b53832600&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fragnemt</a></strong></p><p>A collection of tweets and very short stories from @ctrlcreep. &quot;Why would I want to own a collection of tweets&quot;, you might think, but these are brilliantly etched little gems: dense, fantastical, inventive, awe-inspiring and terrifying. </p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>The forest&#39;s immortal animals are weary of life.

I paid only half the money for them because I knew if I paid full price, the guy organizing everything would run off with the cash. The monkeys had been sitting in Iquitos for weeks, but when it came to actually having to use them for the scene it turned out they had all been sold to an American businessman and were already on a plane waiting to go to the US. We ran to the airport and insisted we were veterinarians and that we had to see the vac- cination papers for the animals.

He displays none of the curiosity, none of the interest in data (while Braudel&#39;s work is filled with numbers, it would not surprise me if Arrighi was innumerate). But he does share Braudel&#39;s attitude towards growth (which is to say that he ignores it).

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Perhaps if we lived on a crest, things would be different. We could at least see.</p></div></blockquote><p>A <em>pleb filter</em> is a piece of art which, by virtue of its impenetrability, &quot;filters out&quot; people with bad taste. What makes the pleb filter such an entertaining addition to online Discourse is that it&#39;s a ready-made kafkatrap, a perfect concept for trolls and shitposters to weaponize: once an artwork has been declared a &quot;pleb filter&quot;—no matter how absurd the claim—any disagreement instantly labels you an unsophisticated rube, a pleb who has been <em>filtered</em>.</p><p>Thus one may find oneself in futile internet conversations trying desperately to explain that, no, <em>Ishtar</em> really is quite bad, that Ringo is not the best Beatle, and that Joel Schumacher&#39;s nipple-Batman is <em>not</em> actually a sublime work of misunderstood cinematic genius. The troll choices are virtually infinite, but work best when applied to creations that are universally agreed to be terrible: the prequels, <em>St. Anger</em>, or the <em>oeuvre</em> of 6ix9ine.</p><p>There are fake filters, like Tarr&#39;s <em>Werckmeister Hamornies</em>—art which tries to be challenging and hints at great depths while actually being quite shallow. A picture of a pool drawn on a piece of paper, and often frustrating because they are a pleb&#39;s idea of a pleb filter. Still, some (like <em>The Magus</em> or <em>The Recognitions</em>) have their charms.</p><p>Finally we have the actual pleb filters, works which are both brilliant and inaccessible. <em>Trout Mask Replica</em>, Michael Mann&#39;s <em>Miami Vice</em>, <em>Faust Part Two</em>, <em>Enter the Void</em>, the <em>Paradiso</em>, Season 2 of <em>True Detective</em>, <em>Fanged Noumena</em>, the <em>Iliad&#39;s</em> catalogue of ships.</p><h2 id="The-IQ-of-Shitposters"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2023/02/06/on-the-pleb-filter/#The-IQ-of-Shitposters" class="headerlink" title="The IQ of Shitposters"></a>The IQ of Shitposters</h2><p>To proclaim the genius of <em>Hamlet</em> is commonplace; to successfully defend <em>The Two Gentlemen of Verona</em> as Shakespeare&#39;s greatest play takes some <em>serious intellectual firepower</em>. Defending the indefensible is a great signal of brainpower: a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/14747049211000317" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent study</a> finds that &quot;bullshit ability is associated with an individual’s intelligence and  individuals capable of producing more satisfying bullshit are judged by second-hand observers to be more intelligent&quot;. The pleb filter is not just a fun tool for trolling, it also offers a great opportunity to show off one&#39;s smarts.</p><p>It is genuinely challenging to truly appreciate the talent and artistry that goes into bullshit—Armond White (perhaps the greatest bullshitter of our time) is himself a pleb filter, perhaps the ultimate one. Some are liable to react with horror, but I think it&#39;s a game worth indulging in. </p><p>At the same time, there&#39;s a countersignaling game being played. On the <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/22/right-is-the-new-left/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">barber pole</a> of intellectual status, the highbrow will adopt lowbrow tastes in order to signal that they&#39;re not midwits. Thus we get <a href="https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/https://doi.org/10.1093/jcr/ucz049" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fancy restaurants serving mac and cheese</a>, and big-brained shitposters defending <em>Showgirls</em>. It is no coincidence that the very idea of the pleb filter was invented on a website whose users are famous for being very smart and pretending to be very stupid.</p><p>Sometimes isolated communities spiral local status markers into overdrive, creating unintentional bad pleb filters, with wild signaling and counter-signaling battles cascading downwards, leaving outside onlookers utterly bewildered. The famously unintelligible world of high fashion offers a memorable, and sometimes beautiful, instance of this phenomenon.</p><!-- https://sociologicalscience.com/articles-v8-12-230/ --><!-- We find that when higher-status individuals are compared with others, they are at the same timemore inclusive in their tastes for genres and more exclusive in their tastes for artists and objects.--><!-- "being culturally open to discrete examples of aesthetic “excellence” within generally unconsecrated cultural forms may have a super-additive effect as a mark of status."--><!-- Dowd et al 2019--><!-- How do pleb filters come about? Sometimes isolated communities spiral status markers into overdrive creating unintentional bad pleb filters, with [wild signaling and counter-signaling battles](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/22/right-is-the-new-left/) [already linked this above?] cascading downwards and leaving outside onlookers utterly bewildered. If you try to post a fit on /r/malefashionadvice, for example, your sartorial choices will probably be ridiculed unless you're wearing a random assortment of incogruous and ill-fitting garments from a thriftshop. [explain what happens when these tastes are exposed to the wider world] [maybe lose this paragraph] --><!-- _Coriolanus_,  --><h2 id="Criticism-and-the-Anxiety-of-the-Filter"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2023/02/06/on-the-pleb-filter/#Criticism-and-the-Anxiety-of-the-Filter" class="headerlink" title="Criticism and the Anxiety of the Filter"></a>Criticism and the Anxiety of the Filter</h2><p>The pleb filter is also a formidable force in the realm of art criticism: the critic must always maintain a position of superiority over his audience, for it is this stance which gives him the authority to dictate what is good or bad. He must therefore never be filtered, and even more importantly never <em>appear</em> to be filtered. Thus he will praise formulaic &quot;high culture&quot; garbage, lest he be mistaken for someone who doesn&#39;t <em>get it</em>.</p><p>When a critic encounters a work that eludes his understanding, something that may surpass his grasp, the anxiety of being filtered becomes <em>palpable</em>—and he often reacts to such works in an extreme way by denigrating them. This is why so many of the great classics were initially met with unfavorable reviews: <em>The Thing</em>, <em>Moby-Dick</em>, <em>Lolita</em>, half of Kubrick&#39;s movies. <em>Chimes at Midnight</em>, Orson Welles&#39;s best film, was savaged when it came out and barely got distribution due to the terrible advance reviews. The anxiety of the filter is to the critic what the anxiety of influence is to the artist.</p><!-- basically there is a SECOND pleb filter at the level of criticism. a metapleb filter. [how is this a pleb filter?] --><h2 id="The-Case-of-Michael-Thomas-Green"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2023/02/06/on-the-pleb-filter/#The-Case-of-Michael-Thomas-Green" class="headerlink" title="The Case of Michael Thomas Green"></a>The Case of Michael Thomas Green</h2><p>The most interesting pleb filters are those that lie exactly on the line between being a troll pleb filter and a real pleb filter: <em>Speed Racer</em>, <em>Love Exposure</em>, the <em>Book of Numbers</em>, the <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> series, perhaps <em>Dhalgren</em>—works where powerful arguments can be made in both directions, works stuck in the limbo between stupidity and genius. Who can forget the iconic image of Sean Connery in the red trunks from <em>Zardoz</em>? There&#39;s a particular form of failure that is borne of great ambition. Take <em>Southland Tales</em>, for example, an utterly bizarre work of deranged grandeur. It is bad <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7YXONuF3dk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beyond belief</a>. And yet there&#39;s something there, something alluring, something that pulls you in and props you up and keeps you watching. </p><p>In 2001, Tom Green wrote, directed, and starred in <em>Freddy Got Fingered</em>, a stupid yet brilliantly fearless comedy about a failed cartoonist and his relationship with his family. The critics hated it, filling their reviews with adjectives like &quot;embarrassing&quot;, &quot;witless&quot;, &quot;vile&quot;, and &quot;sad&quot;, but the film maintains a dedicated following to this day. Some have described it as a surrealist masterpiece, others as a $14 million dollar prank on a movie studio, others as a film before its time. Nathan Rabin writes that &quot;studios exist precisely to keep films this audacious, original, and transgressive from ever hitting theaters&quot;, while <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v_wfECtCvQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lindsay Ellis</a> calls Green &quot;the Orson Welles of our time&quot; and describes <em>Freddy</em> as a film of pure insight into the soul of its creator and a &quot;dadaist masterpiece&quot;. </p><p><em>Freddy</em> offers a perfect example of the anxiety of the filter: Ebert gave it zero stars, but in his infamous review he compares Tom Green to Buñuel, and declares that &quot;the day may come when &quot;Freddy Got Fingered&quot; is seen as a milestone of neo-surrealism.&quot; 16 months after his initial review, Ebert was still thinking about the inscrutable genius of <em>Freddy</em>, writing in his review of <em>Stealing Harvard</em>:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Seeing Tom Green reminded me, as how could it not, of his movie Freddy Got Fingered, which was so poorly received by the film critics that it received only one lonely, apologetic positive review on the Tomatometer. I gave it—let&#39;s see—zero stars. Bad movie, especially the scene where Green was whirling the newborn infant around his head by its umbilical cord. But the thing is, I remember Freddy Got Fingered more than a year later. I refer to it sometimes. It is a milestone. And for all its sins, it was at least an ambitious movie, a go-for-broke attempt to accomplish something. It failed, but it has not left me convinced that Tom Green doesn&#39;t have good work in him. Anyone with his nerve and total lack of taste is sooner or later going to make a movie worth seeing.</p></div></blockquote><!--- Astonishingly, even this aborted failure of Tom Green's was in many ways a success: his character's cartoons perfectly prefigure the (highly successful) productions of Adult Swim over the next decades. ---><!--- Just as defending extreme bullshit is a hard-to-fake signal of intellect, so is taking something borderline-bullshit and making it good. Very similar activities!

Perfection is merely an artifact of insufficient ambition. Errour is the purview of the Great!</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Is it not by risking nothing, by never aiming high, that a writer of low or middling powers keeps generally clear of faults and secure of blame? Whereas the loftier walks of literature are by their very loftiness perilous? [...] Though I have myself noted not a few faulty passages in Homer and in other authors of the highest rank, and though I am far from being partial to their failings, nevertheless I would call them not so much wilful blunders as oversights which were allowed to pass unregarded through that contempt of little things, that “brave disorder,” which is natural to an exalted genius; and I still think that the greater excellences, though not everywhere equally sustained, ought always to be voted to the first place in literature, if for no other reason, for the mere grandeur of soul they reveal. [...] Would you rather be a Homer or an Apollonius?</p></div></blockquote><p>Bolaño plays with this notion in the famous passage on the bookish pharmacist, but I find the most striking echo of this idea is found in Flaubert&#39;s final novel, <em>Bouvard et Pécuchet</em>. He spent nearly a decade working on it, but did not manage to complete it before his death. It is a strange, repetitive work teetering on the brink between comedy and tragedy; ostensibly a work of social criticism, it is really about Flaubert looking inwardly. And it was a radical departure from anything that he (or anyone else) had written before. He writes in a letter:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>At times, the immense scope of this book stuns me. What will come of it? I only hope I’m not deceiving myself into writing something goofy rather than sublime. No, I think not! Something tells me I’m on the right path! But it will be one or the other.</p></div></blockquote><p>He even places some self-relferential meta-commentary on just this topic <em>within</em> the book—</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>He was assailed by doubts. For if mediocre minds (as Longinus observed) are incapable of faults, then faults are committed by the masters—and we should admire them? That’s too much!</p></div></blockquote><p>And for critics, it is exactly this ability to appreciate something great and flawed, as opposed to something small-souled and perfect, that separates the plebeian from the noble taste.</p><h2 id="We-Yearn-Nonetheless"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2023/02/06/on-the-pleb-filter/#We-Yearn-Nonetheless" class="headerlink" title="...We Yearn, Nonetheless..."></a>...We Yearn, Nonetheless...</h2><p>What unites these works in the interstice between the goofy and the sublime is a <em>reckless</em> ambition that goes against all standards of good taste, no not even <em>against</em> but <em>beyond</em>, powered by some unprincipled eruption of creative <em>élan</em>, and not due to some misguided contrarianism but because the old standards are simply incapable of containing the artist&#39;s vision which, pushing out against its own limits, bursts like a star. They are a dive off the edge, a rejection of any interpolation between known points, a heroic leap beyond the confines of the billion-dimensional <a href="https://twitter.com/alexeyguzey/status/1566865664962281472" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latent space of ideas</a>, riding exotic vectors into unknown territories, vectors invisible to all but their discoverer—what Bolaño had in mind when he was writing about those &quot;great, imperfect, torrential works, books that blaze a path into the unknown&quot;.</p><p>Perhaps this ought to be our attitude not just toward our artistic creations, but also the sculpting of our life and character and <a href="https://twitter.com/literalbanana/status/712913395645685760" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even our beliefs</a>.</p><!-- A promising recipe for shaping the creative process that we call "living" and "personality" and "values". --><!-- In short, Glory! --><!-- masterpiece and disaster? --><!-- achilles selecting his fate!

Failed ambition? uniqueness? personal vision as opposed to recapitulating what has come before? ---><p>Great philosophers and artists have always endeavored to chart their own path, to avoid recapitulating the shackles of their social conditioning, to find new vantage points that will allow them to see farther and more clearly. Is this not what Plato was after when he sought out the Pythagoreans in Italy? Is this not what Herodotus was looking for when he was interviewing the sages of Egypt and the Scythians of the Don? Is this not what Nick Land was <em>reaching</em> for when he was &quot;lying on the ground, croaking into a mic while Mackay played jungle records in the background&quot;? It doesn&#39;t always work. But one must at least try.</p><p>&quot;There are two kinds of scientific progress,&quot; declares my old pal Prokhor, &quot;the methodical experimentation and categorization which gradually extend the boundaries of knowledge, and the revolutionary leap of genius which redefines and transcends those boundaries. Acknowledging our debt to the former, we yearn, nonetheless, for the latter.&quot; We yearn indeed, but what dear old Prokhor has omitted is that the leap is risky, and the risk usually fails to pay off. Make no mistake—this is a perilous path. <a href="https://scholars-stage.org/tradition-is-smarter-than-you-are/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tradition is Smarter Than You Are</a>, so striking out in your own direction is almost always doomed to fail. Rapid change is almost always for the worse. Human beings are almost constitutionally incapable of taking ideas seriously. Virtually every gene in our body militates against it. &quot;The more people have epistemic learned helplessness and less they trust extreme ideas, the more they&#39;ll just default to playing Civilized American.&quot; But the Romantically low odds of that heroic action have a bewitching appeal, and our social epistemology works only to the extent that brilliant people are able to ignore it.</p><p>This all converges on liberalism, which postulates that ideas are not to be taken seriously.<span class="tooltip"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2023/02/06/on-the-pleb-filter/#fn255509912" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref255509912">2</sup></a></span> All true masterpieces bear within them an implication of extremism, a deep conviction in the importance of some new, radical idea, an implication that this singular point of view really does matter, and has the strength to overcome all others.

    <updated>2023-01-31T05:17:50.001Z</updated>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the last decade there&#39;s been virtually endless discussion about the effects of austerity on the UK economy. The Guardian: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/03/lost-decade-hidden-story-how-austerity-broke-britain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The lost decade: the hidden story of how austerity broke Britain</a>. FT: <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e9fef496-7bd2-4bee-ac9b-e17359944eae" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Years of austerity are now writ large on the UK state</a>. NYT: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/24/world/europe/britain-austerity-may-budget.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What Is Austerity and How Has It Affected British Society?</a>. And just a few days ago David Wallace-Wells, discussing the country&#39;s growth problems, <a href="https://archive.is/e1Sfg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote that</a> &quot;the country’s obvious struggles have a very obvious central cause: austerity&quot;.</p><p>There&#39;s just a little problem with all of this: there was never any austerity in the UK. It&#39;s a pure media fabrication that persists only because nobody cares to look at the data. </p><p>So, let us bring out the charts! First of all, the UK has been running deficits for more than 20 years now. The deficits were huge even right in the middle of the supposedly austere period. Living beyond your means is not <em>austerity</em>, it&#39;s <em>profligacy</em>.</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/austerity_deficit.png"><p>What does Wallace-Wells say to justify his claims about &quot;austerity&quot;? </p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>In the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, and in the name of rebalancing budgets, the Tory-led government set about cutting annual public spending, as a proportion of G.D.P., to 39 percent from 46 percent.</p></div></blockquote><p>This is technically true, but stupid. The 46% figure comes from the middle of the Global Financial Crisis, when GDP dropped by more than 15% and the government was trying to stimulate the economy. A decade later, spending as % of GDP had simply returned to its pre-recession level. This isn&#39;t &quot;austerity&quot;, it&#39;s just good old regular Keynesian countercyclical fiscal policy. In fact, the UK had already escaped from recession in 2010, and it continued to run huge deficits anyway.<span class="tooltip"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2023/01/31/the-myth-of-austerity-in-the-uk/#fn5166307721" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref5166307721">1</sup></a></span></p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/austerity_spendingpctgdp.png"><p>And to emphasize just how unsustainable this profligacy has been, the UK&#39;s debt-to-GDP ratio has gone from ~35% to ~100% during this period of &quot;austerity&quot;!</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/austerity_debttogdp.png"><p>Did spending ever actually go <em>down</em>? Nope:</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/austerity_spending.jpg"><p>&quot;But Alvaro, there were cuts to this one particular thing I care about, therefore there was austerity.&quot; Sure, spending has been moved around a bit; some areas have gotten more money and others less. As you&#39;d expect from an aging society,<span class="tooltip"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2023/01/31/the-myth-of-austerity-in-the-uk/#fn5166307722" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref5166307722">2</sup></a></span> the UK spends a lot more on healthcare these days than it did 20 years ago; this is just a natural shift in priorities, not austerity. Here&#39;s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/public-spending-statistics-release-may-2022/public-spending-statistics-may-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inflation-adjusted spending broken down by category</a>, straight from His Majesty&#39;s Treasury:<span class="tooltip"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2023/01/31/the-myth-of-austerity-in-the-uk/#fn5166307723" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref5166307723">3</sup></a></span></p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/austerity_realspending.jpg"><p>I would also add that despite the huge increase in healthcare spending, this is the one area that Wallace-Wells chooses to highlight in his article blaming austerity!</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>On average, English ambulances were taking an hour and a half to respond to stroke and heart-attack calls, compared with a target time of 18 minutes; nationwide, 10 times as many patients spent more than four hours waiting in emergency rooms as did in 2011. The waiting list for scheduled treatments recently passed seven million — more than 10 percent of the country — prompting nurses to strike. The National Health Service has been in crisis for years, but over the holidays, as wait times spiked, the crisis moved to the very center of a narrative of national decline.</p></div></blockquote><p>Despite this incredible profligacy, the effects of deficit spending on growth have clearly not been very successful—why then does Wallace-Wells expect that <em>yet more</em> profligacy would somehow avert national decline? The UK government and economy obviously have many problems; austerity is not one of them.</p><div class="subscribediv" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:250px;margin-top:30px;"><form class="validate" action="https://fantasticanachronism.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=2a6ff66ec7039625cb12680d5&amp;amp;id=f713c1306c" method="post" id="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" target="_blank"><div class="mc-field-group"><input class="required email" type="email" name="EMAIL" id="mce-EMAIL" placeholder="Type your email..." value></div><div class="clear" id="mce-responses"><div class="respose" id="mce-error-response" style="display:none"></div><div class="respose" id="mce-success-response" style="display:none"></div></div><div style="position: absolute; left: -5000px" aria-hidden="true"><input type="text" name="b_2a6ff66ec7039625cb12680d5_f713c1306c" tabindex="-1" value></div><div class="clear"><input type="submit" value="Subscribe" name="subscribe" id="mc-embedded-subscribe" clas="button"></div></form></div><div id="footnotes"><hr><div id="footnotelist"><ol style="list-style: none; padding-left: 0; margin-left: 40px"><li id="fn5166307721"><span style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; padding-right: 10px; margin-left: -40px">1.</span><span><span class="footnote-contents">You could make some output gap arguments for deficit spending here but whatever.</span><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2023/01/31/the-myth-of-austerity-in-the-uk/#fnref5166307721" rev="footnote"> ↩</a></span></li><li id="fn5166307722"><span style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; padding-right: 10px; margin-left: -40px">2.</span><span><span class="footnote-contents">The median age in the UK has increased by ~6 years since the GFC; the elderly have gone from ~15% of the population to over 25%.</span><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2023/01/31/the-myth-of-austerity-in-the-uk/#fnref5166307722" rev="footnote"> ↩</a></span></li><li id="fn5166307723"><span style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; padding-right: 10px; margin-left: -40px">3.</span><span><span class="footnote-contents">Note that the education figures are not comparable before and after 2011 due to a methodological change.</span><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2023/01/31/the-myth-of-austerity-in-the-uk/#fnref5166307723" rev="footnote"> ↩</a></span></li></ol></div></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="The-Best"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2023/01/23/the-best-and-worst-books-i-read-in-2022/#The-Best" class="headerlink" title="The Best"></a>The Best</h1><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/bb22_passenger.jpg" class="floatleft nofancybox"><p>Cormac McCarthy, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Passenger-Box-Set-Stella-Maris/dp/0593536045?keywords=the+passenger&qid=1672244673&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=f2464ae2e779922885489a536ce28c30&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Passenger/Stella Maris</a></strong></p><p>A salvage diver (Bobby <em>Western</em>) is sent to investigate a plane at the bottom of the ocean. Somehow the plane is intact and one of the passengers is missing. When he gets back, shadowy government agents are after him. Western is also a genius mathematician and a racing car driver. This is a potboiler! </p><p>On the other hand we have the deranged visions of his sister, in a Pynchonian absurdist mode. The thriller plotline is quickly abandoned, and the rest of the novel plays out mostly in a series of conversations. Mathematics, physics, the atomic bomb, JFK assassination conspiracy theories, the role of the unconscious: this is a novel of ideas in many ways. At the same time it&#39;s deeply romantic, filled to the brim with longing, regret, loss, and love. It&#39;s an incredibly sad book. </p><p>Overall this is a novel that strikes out in many directions, many times in unsatisfying and imprecise and undisciplined ways, but it somehow achieves an effect. &quot;Blaze paths into the unknown&quot; etc. To the usual McCarthyan mix of Hemingway and Captain Ahab, he now adds heavy doses of Pynchon and DeLillo.</p><p>Perhaps the passenger is the conscious, or the unconscious, or they&#39;re both passengers (probably all of the above).</p><p>The second novel is a series of conversations between Bobby&#39;s sister Alicia and her psychiatrist, a short time before she commits suicide. It&#39;s mostly a companion piece, and many times it feels like Alicia is McCarthy&#39;s mouthpiece. It&#39;s about mathematics and giving up mathematics and the foundation of mathematics, about language, about meaning in a godless world, about the inability to experience the world directly and the effects of various intermediation mechanisms (including language), about love and longing, about the burden of knowledge, about intelligence, evolution and evolutionary psychology, physics and the bomb and the sins of the father. Both books try their damnest to tackle Gnosticism.</p><p>One of the best works in many years, I can&#39;t wait to go back to it.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Here is a story. The last of all men who stands alone in the universe while it darkens about him. Who sorrows all things with a single sorrow. Out of the pitiable and exhausted remnants of what was once his soul he’ll find nothing from which to craft the least thing godlike to guide him in these last of days. </p></div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Cantor, Gauss, Riemann, Euler. Hilbert. Poincaré. Noether. Hypatia. Klein, Minkowski, Turing, von Neumann. Hardly even a partial list. Cauchy, Lie, Dedekind, Brouwer. Boole. Peano. Church is still alive. Hamilton, Laplace, Lagrange. The ancients of course. You look at these names and the work they represent and you realize that the annals of latterday literature and philosophy by comparison are barren beyond description. </p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both;"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/bb22_wolfe.jpg" class="floatright nofancybox"><p>Gene Wolfe, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Island-Doctor-Death-Other-Stories/dp/0312863543?keywords=The+Island+of+Doctor+Death+and+Other+Stories+and+Other+Stories&qid=1674480945&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=1164a9b19634e2e8e17d38a9793627bd&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Island of Doctor Death and Other Stories and Other Stories</a></strong></p><p>Slightly uneven but the best stories are really great: in particular I loved Feather Tigers, Death of Dr. Island, Toy Theater, and Seven American Nights. Loads of classic Wolfeian mindfuckery. Many of the stories are in that classic Wolfe style where you have to piece together what&#39;s going on from tiny hints left in the text, and it&#39;s all a bit ambiguous in the end and so on. There&#39;s a lot of focus on religion (often explicitly Christian) and death. Two stories, The Hero as Werwolf and The Doctor of Death Island, being fairly explicitly death-ist. Technology and its social effects, the problem of evil, mastery of art versus human relations, the hollowness of immortality, how people would react to a messianic figure, and more!</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>An exaggerated and solemn respect always indicates a loss of faith.</p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both;"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/bb22_tott.jpg" class="floatleft nofancybox"><p>François, Baron de Tott, <strong><a href="https://sylviaioannoufoundation.org/en/collection/digital-library/b0077/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Memoirs of the Baron De Tott, on the Turks and the Tartars</a></strong></p><p>A look into the past, from the past. Filled with fascinating little observations (I found the book through an anecdote about forks which Braudel mentions in C&amp;C). Roughly at the time the American revolution was happening, the same time when Johnson and Boswell were drinking too much claret at the Mitre, de Tott was joining the Crimean Tatars on a slave raid into Southern Russia. He spent many years in the Ottoman empire over two stints, and finally also traveled around the middle east. Most fascinating for its observations of Ottoman society, and the role de Tott played in the Russo-Turkish war of &#39;68-&#39;74. Somewhat niche, but definitely worth a read if this is your kind of thing. </p><p>What causes the fall of empires? Culture, Tott says: all decay ultimately comes from within. He&#39;s particular critical of the effects of despotism in government: everyone&#39;s place is precarious and there is no room for prosocial ambition. Simultaneously totally lawless but also extremely despotic—anarcho-tyranny at its finest, made worse by abitrary and capricious system of punishments.</p><p>Oh, and the introduction by the translator is absolutely hilarious (unintentionally).</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>How can so Sovereign a contempt for human nature amongst the Turks consist with that whimsical beneficence they display towards certain animals the most useless to fociety? Barbarity itself, no doubt, stands in need of some relaxation, whilst it crushes mankind under the weight of its iron secptre, it condescends to smile on objects whole insignificance give no occasion for alarm; and the pride of the despot blending all beings together in one common Contempt, selects its favourites from amongst the weakelt. </p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both;"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/bb22_sartorresartus.jpg" class="floatright nofancybox"><p>Thomas Carlyle, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sartor-Resartus-Oxford-Worlds-Classics/dp/0199540373?crid=3CAYQFX073Z2D&keywords=sartor+resartus&qid=1674480030&sprefix=sartor+%2Caps%2C1221&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=8944a6defa3899411f5b1ea2007f32e9&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sartor Resartus</a></strong></p><p>A review of a fictional philosophical tome on clothing, with various notes on the life of its author, the also fictional Diogenes Teufelsdröckh. Imagine a mix between Borges, Laurence Sterne, and Fichte. And it&#39;s got Carlyle&#39;s ridiculous style (which was extreme even in his own time) to top things off. And you can almost never tell when it&#39;s serious and when it&#39;s not. This book caused Emerson to start corresponding with Carlyle, and even inspired Borges to learn German!</p><p>In Sartor Resartus, only a lifelong quest for knowledge can lead one to the truth that knowledge is unattainable (or perhaps the other way around?). Carlyle hates the limiting effect of the standard philosophical approaches of his time, so he instead opts for this extreme type of illegible, non-linear anti-discourse in which everything is both deadly serious and potentially an ironic joke. What I&#39;m saying is that Carlyle was the first zoomer.  </p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>The age of Curiosity, like that of Chivalry, is indeed, properly speaking, gone. Yet perhaps only gone to sleep: for here arises the Clothes-Philosophy to resuscitate, strangely enough, both the one and the other! Should sound views of this Science come to prevail, the essential nature of the British Dandy, and the mystic significance that lies in him, cannot always remain hidden under laughable and lamentable hallucination. The following long Extract from Professor Teufelsdröckh may set the matter, if not in its true light, yet in the way towards such. It is to be regretted however that, here as so often elsewhere, the Professor’s keen philosophic perspicacity is somewhat marred by a certain mixture of almost owlish purblindness, or else of some perverse, ineffectual, ironic tendency, our readers shall judge which</p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both;"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/bb22_nostromo.jpg" class="floatleft nofancybox"><p>Joseph Conrad, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nostromo-Tale-Seaboard-Penguin-Classics/dp/0141441631?crid=3LHKPA46F2I1W&keywords=Nostromo+conrad&qid=1665068938&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIzLjE2IiwicXNhIjoiMi42OCIsInFzcCI6IjIuOTMifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=nostromo+conr%2Caps%2C215&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=3cdbbaffe558157e7b3cf5afd4aeb9bf&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nostromo</a></strong></p><p>To say that it&#39;s about a dockworker would be both true and misleading. Nostromo is the dashing <em>Capataz de Cargadores</em>, a man obsessed with his image and driven to heroic tasks out of a desire to maintain it. </p><p>A chopped-up story from various points of view, the narrative is kaleidoscopically structured: fragmented, unclear, conflicting, and circular. Character motivations and world-views clash with each other as the fate of Costaguana is determined. Politics, heroism, revolt (internal and external), the worth of social status, reputations, perceptions, allegiances, and material vs idealistic interests. Betrayals of all kinds. Private and public vindications and redemptions. Great stuff.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>To be a millionaire, and such a millionaire as Holroyd, is like being eternally young. The audacity of youth reckons upon what it fancies an unlimited time at its disposal; but a millionaire has unlimited means in his hand—which is better.

A kind of nihilistic telos for all intellectual pursuits, with an alluring beauty all of its own. The actual game itself is never described; instead we follow the life of Joseph Knecht from student, to leader of the order, and the next steps after that, as he is torn between the real world and the ivory tower. </p><p>The Borges influence can be felt throughout, and there&#39;s nothing quite like it.</p><p>The life of the mind, asceticism, the lifecycle of organizations, hierarchies and servitude, purpose and nihilism, beauty, sacrifice, duty, transcendence.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Especially for young men with gifts like those of Joseph Knecht, who have not been driven by a single talent to concentrate on a specialty, but whose nature rather aims at integration, synthesis, and universality, this springtide of free study is often a period of intense happiness and very nearly of intoxication. Were it not preceded by the discipline of the elite schools, by the psychic hygiene of meditation exercises and the lenient supervision of the Board of Educators, this freedom would even be dangerous for such natures and might prove a nemesis to many, as it used to be to innumerable highly gifted young men in the ages before our present educational pattern was set, in the pre-Castalian centuries. The universities in those days literally swarmed with young Faustian spirits who embarked with all sails set upon the high seas of learning and academic freedom, and ran aground on all the shoals of untrammeled dilettantism. Faust himself, after all, was the prototype of brilliant amateurishness and its consequent tragedy.</p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both;"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/bb22_hhhh.jpg" class="floatleft nofancybox"><p>Laurent Binet, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/HHhH-Novel-Laurent-Binet/dp/1250033349?crid=1L0F2SXZLWTG8&keywords=hhhh&qid=1665069364&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIyLjk3IiwicXNhIjoiMS44OCIsInFzcCI6IjEuOTMifQ%3D%3D&s=books&sprefix=hhh%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C331&sr=1-1&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.006c50ae-5d4c-4777-9bc0-4513d670b6bc&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=fc3ef7e193cbe588aaceefd32b8f97f6&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HHhH</a></strong></p><p><em>Himmlers Hirn heißt Heydrich</em>. The story of Operation Anthropoid (to assassinate Reinhard Heydrich in Prague) and everything that led up to it. 257 short chapters, sometimes consisting of nothing more than a quotation. It&#39;s a blend of a mostly-historical retelling of the operation with a ton of metafictional elements on top. Binet constantly comments on the issues with constructing a historical novel, compares his approach to other books and movies, and even brings his personal life into it. Irony, humor, self-consciousness (especially about the author&#39;s view of Heydrich), the tension between history and fiction, and a slow, horrific build-up that absolutely fills you with terror. Incredible that this book can manage such a powerful emotional effect despite the ironic tone. The absurd scenes (whether comical or horrific) are true, which makes the whole thing so strange. Goring is showing off his model train set to Heydrich when he&#39;s there to get the final solution started...</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Anyway, the RSHA hydra has enough heads to keep him busy. So now he has to delegate. He gives each of the RSHA’s seven divisions to a colleague who is selected first and foremost for his abilities rather than his politics—and this is rare enough to be worth mentioning in the lunatic asylum that is the Nazi regime. Heinrich Müller, for example, who is put in charge of the Gestapo—and who identifies so completely with his job that hereafter he is known simply as “Gestapo” Müller—is a former Christian Democrat: an affiliation that does not prevent him from becoming one of the Nazis’ most devastating weapons. The other RSHA offices are given to brilliant intellectuals: youngsters such as Ohlendorf (Inland-SD) and Schellenberg (Ausland-SD), or experienced academics like Six (Written Records). Such men contrast strongly with the cohort of cranks, illiterates, and mental degenerates who populate the Party’s higher echelons. One minor branch of the Gestapo—a status that does not reflect its true importance, but it’s always better to remain discreet with such sensitive subjects—is devoted to Jewish affairs. Heydrich already knows who he wants to run it: that little Austrian Hauptsturmführer who did such good work before, Adolf Eichmann. </p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both;"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/bb22_bouvard.jpg" class="floatright nofancybox"><p>Gustave Flaubert, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bouvard-Pecuchet-P%C3%A9cuchet-Gustave-Flaubert/dp/1564783936?crid=2TPXIKA0DJZIY&keywords=Bouvard+and+Pecuchet&qid=1672244859&sprefix=the+selected+poetry+of+rainer+maria+rilke%2Caps%2C775&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=641a35b2ab65b19d5b842eca16d24a85&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bouvard and Pecuchet</a></strong></p><p>It&#39;s difficult to write anything about this bizarre, unfinished novel. Despite being comic or satirical, it&#39;s never really funny. It&#39;s extraordinarily repetitive. There are really no characters, no plot, no development of any sort. And yet it&#39;s a powerful commentary on the tragedy of the human quest for knowledge. With it, Flaubert renounced all his earlier technique and essentially inaugurated the 20th century (post-)modernist tradition in literature. I can&#39;t really recommend it, but it&#39;s a unique masterpiece.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>They no longer had a single fixed idea about the individuals and events of that time. To form an impartial judgment, they would have to read every history, every memoir, every newspaper and manuscript, for the slightest omission could foster an error that would lead to others, and on unto infinity. They gave up. But they had acquired a taste for history, a need for truth for its own sake. Perhaps the truth was more easily uncovered in earlier periods? Surely the authors recounted events more dispassionately at a greater remove. And they delved into the good Rollin. “What a load of hogwash!” cried Bouvard as of the first chapter. </p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both;"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/bb22_america.jpg" class="floatleft nofancybox"><p>Alexis de Tocqueville, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Democracy-America-text-only-Tocqueville/dp/B0043QWB68?keywords=Democracy+in+America+everyman&qid=1656875469&sr=8-2&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=16e495a05fc03a6fa57dffe0e50f0adb&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democracy in America</a></strong></p><p>Here&#39;s a book that manages to entirely live up to its reputation.

I believe Cormac’s recent novels The Passenger and Stella Maris have their origins partly in this foment of ideas that connect domains of unyielding precision to the frailty of life and the militancy of society.</p></div></blockquote><p>4&#x2E; <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/12/19/cormac-mccarthy-peers-into-the-abyss-the-passenger-stella-maris" target="_blank" rel="noopener">James Wood&#39;s review</a> is pretty good: &quot;To traffic in serious mathematics is to commune with truth; to traffic in words, to merely write novels, is to produce dim approximations of the truth.

Dark and beautiful. This may well be the last great novel of the human era in literature. It would be fitting for the 89-year old McCarthy to be writing a coda for himself and humanity at the same time. Especially since he views the 20th century productions of science and engineering as far more important and groundbreaking than those in literature.</p><p>The plot is mostly irrelevant. Both books consist mostly of conversations: bars and restaurants for the first, a psychiatric institution for the second. McCarthy grapples with every idea that&#39;s been on his mind for the last few decades: mathematics, physics, language, the unconscious, the sins of the father, Kant, evolution, psychology, gnosticism, genius. It&#39;s not just a novel of ideas, though—<em>The Passenger</em> is filled with yearning, regret, nostalgia, isolation...just an incredibly melancholic atmosphere in general.

    <title>Forecasting Forecasting</title>

    <updated>2022-11-21T13:38:22.749Z</updated>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The forecasting ecosystem is in a weird spot right now. The &quot;traditional&quot; approach began with  large-scale experiments focusing on the wisdom of the crowds, market mechanisms, etc. People were inspired by the predictive power of financial markets and wanted to replicate their strengths in other domains—policy, diplomacy, war, disease, science.</p><p>We quickly began to see a divergence, starting with the &quot;superforecaster&quot; phenomenon: researchers noticed that certain people consistently outperformed the rest, and if you focused on their views you could outperform both the experts and the crowd. Competitive prediction aggregation/market platforms also have serious issues with information sharing between participants, which is a big part of why teams of top forecasters outperform markets as a whole. It has taken a long time for this movement to play out, but I feel it has been accelerating lately and wanted to write down a few comments on where I think forecasting is headed.</p><p>One issue is identifying superforecasters. If you don&#39;t have access to them (they are GJO&#39;s moat in a way), then you need to find them on your own (or at least find a way to reach out to them and attract them). Thus other projects like CSET/INFER ran crowd forecasting platforms and then picked out the top predictors for their &quot;pro team&quot;, for example. Recent <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Dm5eNgyvEwF9ibvzj/participate-in-the-hybrid-forecasting-persuasion-tournament" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI forecasting efforts</a> have also tried to pick out a small number of top forecasters. And then you have groups like <a href="https://www.swiftcentre.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swift</a> and <a href="https://samotsvety.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Samotsvety</a> (as Scott Alexander says, &quot;If the point of forecasting tournaments is to figure out who you can trust, the science has spoken, and the answer is “these guys”.&quot;). Why pay tens of thousands for a prediction market (which takes time and effort to organize) when you can just give a couple of grand to Nuño and get better answers, faster?</p><p>Others have tried to do away with the market mechanism even without having access to top forecasting talent. The DARPA SCORE program (which I&#39;ve written about before) had two separate components for prediction, one market-based (Replication Markets) and another which used a structured group discussion format to arrive at estimates (RepliCATS). The results aren&#39;t out yet, but my understanding is that RepliCATS outperformed the markets. </p><p>Personally, I find the shift from open markets and various fancy scoring and incentive mechanisms to &quot;put a handful of smart dudes in a room and ask them questions&quot; a bit disappointing. Why did we even need the markets and forecasting platforms in the first place? To identify the smart dudes, of course—but is that all there is to it? As the top forecasters abandon markets and start competing against them, they are (in a way) pulling up the ladder behind them. We need the public tournaments to identify the talent in the first place, but if the money just goes straight into Samotsvety&#39;s pockets instead of open tournaments, new people can&#39;t join the ecosystem any more. Where is the next Samotsvety going to come from? Part of the problem is that there&#39;s a positive externality to identifying forecasting talent and it&#39;s difficult to capture that value, so we end up with a bit of a market failure.</p><p>Perhaps the only way to make markets competitive is to make them lucrative enough that it&#39;s worthwhile to form hedge fund-like teams which can generate <em>internal</em> benefits from information-sharing and deploy those onto the market, with the added benefit of honing them through competition. But that seems unlikely at the moment, the money just isn&#39;t there.</p><p>In one of the possible worlds ahead of us, the endpoint of this process will be the re-creation of the consulting firm—except for real this time. With the right kind of marketing angle I could easily see Samotsvety becoming a kind of 21st century McKinsey for the hip SV crowd that wants to signal that it needs <em>actual</em> advice rather than political cover. Could the forecasters avoid the pitfalls of the consultancy world?</p><p>What are the limits to forecasting accuracy? Eli Lifland <a href="https://www.foxy-scout.com/retro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is skeptical</a> about the possibility of improving his abilities, but I&#39;m not sure I buy that line entirely. We&#39;re still very early on, and many obvious low-hanging fruits have yet to be tried. If the forecasting-group-as-consultancy takes off, I would expect to see many serious attempts at improvement, starting with things like teaching domain experts forecasting and then putting them in close collaboration with top-tier generalists and forecasters. </p><p>What worries me is that this is a movement away from objective scoring and back towards reputation-based systems of trust. Once you leave the world of open markets and platforms, you become disconnected from their inescapable, public, and powerful error-correcting mechanisms—weak arguments can once again be laundered in the dirty soapwater of prominence and influence. Perhaps the current crop of top forecasters have the integrity to avoid going down that path, but how can that be maintained in the long run, with a powerful headwind of incentives and entryism blowing against us? </p><div class="subscribediv" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:250px;margin-top:30px;"><form class="validate" action="https://fantasticanachronism.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=2a6ff66ec7039625cb12680d5&amp;amp;id=f713c1306c" method="post" id="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" target="_blank"><div class="mc-field-group"><input class="required email" type="email" name="EMAIL" id="mce-EMAIL" placeholder="Type your email..." value></div><div class="clear" id="mce-responses"><div class="respose" id="mce-error-response" style="display:none"></div><div class="respose" id="mce-success-response" style="display:none"></div></div><div style="position: absolute; left: -5000px" aria-hidden="true"><input type="text" name="b_2a6ff66ec7039625cb12680d5_f713c1306c" tabindex="-1" value></div><div class="clear"><input type="submit" value="Subscribe" name="subscribe" id="mc-embedded-subscribe" clas="button"></div></form></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="From-Above-Metaethics"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2022/10/10/against-effective-altruism/#From-Above-Metaethics" class="headerlink" title="From Above: Metaethics"></a>From Above: Metaethics</h1><p>You&#39;re (probably) all theological anti-realists; just apply the same reasoning to the existence of moral facts! If the magical invisible sky god is obviously fake, why do you accept magical invisible sky moral facts? Just take the standard &quot;rationalist&quot; toolkit, apply it to realism, and it disappears in a puff of smoke. The arguments can just be copy pasted: for example, one of the classic (and most powerful) arguments from the New Atheism internet wars was that theists are really atheists about every god except their own. The moral realist is an anti-realist about all moral claims except the ones he happens to like! What is the base rate of moral truth, and why do you believe your inside view is enough to overcome that?</p><p>Realist arguments always come across as utterly absurd because their task is 1) extremely simple and obvious, and 2) impossible. All they have to do is say &quot;we used methods x, y, z to uncover moral facts a, b, c, and you can replicate the procedure independently to verify our results&quot;. But it&#39;s never like that, it&#39;s always some interminable verbcel nonsense to cover up the fact that they don&#39;t actually have any access to the moral facts that their theory says they <em>should</em> have access to! </p><p>Whenever I hear the word &quot;intuition&quot; out of the mouth of a philosopher I reach for my Browning!<span class="tooltip"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2022/10/10/against-effective-altruism/#fn10280584171" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref10280584171">1</sup></a></span> </p><p>It comes down to this:</p><ul><li>Naturalism: no evidence</li><li>Non-naturalism: magic</li></ul><p>Often they&#39;ll back off and come up with excuses about why moral facts aren&#39;t accessible in that way, but that just wrecks the whole thing. Even if realism <em>is</em> true, if there&#39;s no reliable empirical access to moral facts, then that&#39;s functionally equivalent to anti-realism. Any defense based on the immunity of moral propositions to empirical investigation also makes it impossible to find the truth. Your metaethics either has to have a way to determine what&#39;s true in ethics, or you&#39;re practically a nihilist.</p><p>Traditionally the problem has been solved with an appeal to God but EAs are, to a first approximation, 100% atheist. You can&#39;t pull an <em>Euthyphro</em> any more, so WHAT&#39;S YOUR MORAL EPISTEMOLOGY MOTHERFUCKER? Why do epistemic standards seem to suddenly disappear when it comes to utilitarianism? Why am I constantly being asked to believe in the existence of these ontologically redundant entities?</p><p>The <em>theologians</em> at least have the decency to offer <em>some</em> kind of story: ask them about the origin of God and they might invoke the cosmological argument or the principle of sufficient reason. Ask a <em>moralogian</em> about the origin of moral facts and all you&#39;ll get in return is a stupefied bovine expression. The <em>theologians</em> can <em>at least</em> appeal to miracles. The <em>moralogians</em> appeal to <em>nothing</em> and expect you to accept it! Is the origin of moral facts natural, or supernatural? If natural, can we engineer our own? Why or why not? The universe, fundamentally, is dumb. You are positing the existence of entities that are very much not dumb. Where the hell did they come from?</p><p>Above all the <em>moralogian</em> is conspicuously shameless. Even in the 13th century, a man like Aquinas (who would not meet a single doubter in his entire life) felt it necessary to justify his faith and present arguments in favor of the existence of God. Today&#39;s moralogian on the other hand feels no such compulsion, although he is beset on all sides by skeptics! The EA.org <a href="https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/metaethics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">page on meta-ethics</a> speaks for itself:</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/ea_metaethics.png"> <p>Is this an excess of certainty, or is it because deep down the moralogian knows he has no real arguments? </p><p>And the moralogians are not stuck in airy castles of thought, they operate in the real world. The neoconservatives, for example, are a showcase of what happens when the moralogian takes hold of the reins of foreign policy—and it is a consistent ideology that genuinely seeks to spread the values it values. Buckhardt wrote that the foreign policy of Italian states of the Renaissance, free as it was from &quot;moral scruples&quot;, gave him &quot;the impression of a bottomless abyss&quot;. But who today could not prefer that naked self-interest to the neocon disaster of democracy and human rights? The effective altruists have yet to screw up that badly, but just look at the people who want to eliminate all wildlife and you have a good preview of what is possible—&quot;<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/10177384-man-your-head-is-haunted-you-have-wheels-in-your" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Man, your head is haunted!</a>&quot;</p><p>Peter Singer offers one of the most memorable instances of intellectual cowardice in the entire history of philosophy. Like any reasonable person, he used to be an anti-realist. Then he read Parfit and realized that anti-realism meant utilitarianism was not the case (not sure why it took Parfit to point that out to him). Instead of abandoning utilitarianism, he became a realist just to salvage his ideology! Pathetic.</p><p>Hilariously, Parfit later abandoned realism for what he calls &quot;non-realist cognitivism&quot;, which is basically the Sam Harris view except with bigger words.<span class="tooltip"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2022/10/10/against-effective-altruism/#fn10280584172" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref10280584172">2</sup></a></span> Part 7 of vol. 3 of <em>On What Matters</em> is an incredible trainwreck, worth skimming just to see what kind of pretzel shapes people will contort themselves into in order to avoid accepting the obvious. At least Parfit understands that adding a magical normative layer on top of reality is completely incompatible with the scientific <em>weltanschauung</em>. </p><p>&quot;But Alvaro, your instrumental goals are sort of like morality, maybe we could just re-brand...&quot; Just let it go, man.</p><h1 id="From-Straight-Ahead-What-39-s-Going-On-Here"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2022/10/10/against-effective-altruism/#From-Straight-Ahead-What-39-s-Going-On-Here" class="headerlink" title="From Straight Ahead: What&#39;s Going On Here?"></a>From Straight Ahead: What&#39;s Going On Here?</h1><p>You&#39;re not actually a utilitarian anyway. At best it&#39;s a kind of ideal. That&#39;s why you <em>tithe</em> 10%. Just go with the 90% of your intuition that says &quot;this shit is whack, yo&quot;. How do ideologies avoid purity spirals? <a href="https://handsandcities.com/2021/03/07/care-and-demandingness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heuristics against demandingness</a>. It’s one heuristic battling another! Why not go all the way with the one that’s winning?</p><p>So you&#39;re probably not a realist, and probably not a utilitarian either...where does this EA compulsion come from? You must have been memed into it. Don&#39;t feel bad, it happens to all of us, that&#39;s how these things work. </p><h1 id="From-Below-Genealogy"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2022/10/10/against-effective-altruism/#From-Below-Genealogy" class="headerlink" title="From Below: Genealogy"></a>From Below: Genealogy</h1><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Nature has never generated a terminal value except through hypertrophy of an instrumental value.

They&#39;re not misfiring, <em>you are</em>. </p><p>Of course the problem with optimizing for status is that if you&#39;re <em>seen</em> as optimizing for status rather than having a plausible excuse<span class="tooltip"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2022/10/10/against-effective-altruism/#fn10280584174" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref10280584174">4</sup></a></span>, it&#39;s bad—the altruism that increases your status the most is also the one that you can credibly signal that you <em>actually believe in</em>. Thus we get Triversian self-deception where the altruist &quot;really means it&quot; (but of course if he really meant it he wouldn&#39;t be giving 10%). So <em>Actual</em> Effective Altruism is simply too gauche to exist. If you hang around the Bay Aryan rationalists then EA may well satisfy those goals (and I&#39;m sure there are many in EA purely for cynical reasons). But if you&#39;re not part of that crowd...</p><p>Scott Alexander <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/07/24/value-differences-as-differently-crystallized-metaphysical-heuristics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writes</a> that &quot;all of our values are unjustifiable crystallizations of heuristics at some level&quot;, and then continues specifically on utilitarianism:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>To be absolutely brutal about it:</p><p>EXPLICIT MODEL: Helping others will key me in to networks of reciprocal altruism and raise my status in the community<br>EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCE: Desire to help others, empathy, horror at the suffering of others<br>REIFIED ESSENCE: “Utility”<br>ENDORSED VALUE: Utilitarianism, the belief that maximizing utility is  the highest good regardless of what other goods it produces&quot;</p></div></blockquote><p>It&#39;s spot on! How someone can write that and go on believing in utilitarianism is beyond me, and Scott offers no explanation.</p><p>Now, you might be thinking &quot;But Alvaro, you idiot, we&#39;re adaptation executors, not fitness maximizers! This is all perfectly alright, you see.&quot; Sure, we&#39;re adaptation executors, but that doesn&#39;t give you a blank check to execute whatever retarded adaptation was bred into your hairy great-....great-grandfather 500,000 years ago, and is now <a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2020/03/03/memetic-defoundation/">incompatible with the world you live in</a> (or worse, become enslaved to &quot;unjustified crystallizations&quot; and meticulously engineered hyperstimuli designed to abuse your adaptations). Effective altruism is the coca cola of morality, and <em>you</em> are morally <em>obese</em>!</p><p>The adaptation for helping out people in your community has hypertrophied in the toxic sludge of modern civilization into an absurd ideology about maximizing imaginary sky utilons by helping people you will never meet, or who do not yet (and may never) exist. Given the rapid shift in our environment it&#39;s unsurprising that there are maladaptations in our system; but we can recognize and avoid them. Your &quot;adaptation execution&quot; has been memetically hijacked—where once you would get good things in return for your &quot;altruism&quot; (a stronger community, status, reciprocal altruism, coalition-building, or even &quot;niceness, community, and civilization&quot;), a runaway meme has now convinced you that it&#39;s actually better to get <em>nothing</em>!<span class="tooltip"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2022/10/10/against-effective-altruism/#fn10280584175" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref10280584175">5</sup></a></span> You get all the costs of religion, and none of the prosocial benefits! Even worse, the infected are trying to spread this meme to others. Things are in the saddle, and ride <em>you</em>! It&#39;s a particularly dumb version of your typical California cult in which there isn&#39;t <em>even</em> a creepy guy with a harem of underage girls at the top. What&#39;s the point, man?</p><p>There was a type of deer in Ireland whose antlers hypertrophied (probably through sexual selection) to the point that it killed off the entire species. When I look at effective altruists, all I see is overgrown antlers pulling them to the ground.</p><p>The absurdity is heightened because we <em>obviously know where these tendencies come from</em>, regardless of what philosophers try to imagine. We know where the evolved desire to gobble up an entire cake comes from—as you resist the clarion call of the chocolate cake, so you must also resist the call of &quot;effective&quot; altruism. A serious valuing of values can only begin when this baggage is dispensed with and laughed at.</p><!-- "Are you saying I shouldn't donate to charity?" Not at all. Just do so..._effectively_. --><!-- bad justification, don't need metaphysical values can have only instrumental ones, certainly takes away all sorts of properties we associate with morality, etc. shifting between values and morality is BS to cover up the lack of moral imperative --><h1 id="Fin"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2022/10/10/against-effective-altruism/#Fin" class="headerlink" title="Fin"></a>Fin</h1><p>There are plenty of arguments against utilitarianism&#39;s internal logic: problems with interpersonal comparisons, aggregation, second-order effects, negative utility, average utility, discounting, etc. Whether you go negative, average, rule, or <em>fluorescent</em> there are tons of inescapable and fatal flaws. Empirically, human beings <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1043463118784888?journalCode=rssa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don&#39;t have coherent utility functions</a> so what are we even maximizing? Above all, utilitarians ignore the value (and necessity) of suffering—for life and for Life. The fine porcelain of your being was forged in the fires of hell. </p><p>But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary to meet utilitarianism on its own turf, so...<span class="tooltip"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2022/10/10/against-effective-altruism/#fn10280584176" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref10280584176">6</sup></a></span></p><p>Let me also say that atheism for the masses, in retrospect, was an enormous error. Organized religion as a social technology is invaluable and the modern atomized welfare state is a pathetic replacement. Atheism for the intellectual class is perfectly alright, but in the age of mass literacy there is really no barrier between them and the rest of society. Was atheism inevitable? Perhaps. But the New Atheists certainly didn&#39;t help. Extrapolating this line of reasoning is left as an exercise to the reader.</p><p>Are there values which are not merely instrumental?

Tangled, fragmented, unclear, conflicting, and circular narratives/motivations/goals/priorities. A chopped-up story from various points of view, taking a look at a world filled with great characters surrounding the titular Nostromo. Politics, heroism, revolt, the worth of social status, reputations, perceptions, allegiances, and material vs idealistic interests. Betrayals of all kinds.

Fascinating Borgesian novel about a futuristic game that combines all arts and sciences into some sort of grand unified plaything.

There&#39;s a series of parallel fantastical stories set in a virtual reality and they&#39;re all pointless and awful. A bit outdated in terms of how it imagines the internet, it does have a few interesting ideas but overall I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth the effort.</li></ul><ul><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296?crid=188FBFXHT5WSD&keywords=Zero+to+One&qid=1665069123&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIyLjAzIiwicXNhIjoiMS44NCIsInFzcCI6IjIuMDUifQ%3D%3D&s=books&sprefix=city+of+golden+shadow%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C562&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=9057fa99bccacc46f86cdc519d4cf810&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zero to One</a></strong> by Peter Thiel.

Split into 257 short chapters, it blends a straightfoward and minimally fictionalized retelling of Operation Anthropoid (the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich) with all sorts of metafictional elements, as Binet constantly comments on the issues with constructing a historical novel, compares his approach to other books and movies, and even brings his personal life into it. Irony, humor, self-consciousness (especially about the author&#39;s view of Heydrich), the tension between history and fiction, and a slow, horrific build-up that absolutely fills you with terror. Strange how powerful emotionally a book that is at the same time so detached can be. Quite good and very different.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Man-Who-Loved-Only-Numbers/dp/0786884061?crid=30PLW4QLCRWDA&keywords=The+Man+Who+Loved+Only+Numbers&qid=1665069512&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIwLjI4IiwicXNhIjoiMC4yNCIsInFzcCI6IjAuMzIifQ%3D%3D&s=books&sprefix=the+man+who+loved+only+numbers%2Cstripbooks%2C340&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=4e197068f0851d6b2ab8b1dcefcdcdd5&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Man Who Loved Only Numbers: The Story of Paul Erdős and the Search for Mathematical Truth</a></strong> by Paul Hoffman.

Carroll. A curious artifact from a different era. Perfectly captures the zeitgeist of the peak of internet atheism and creationism debates. One could make statements about human evolution then which would be quite dangerous today. The stuff on DNA and evolution is pretty wide and not that deep. All of it has been covered better elsewhere. There&#39;s a chapter on EvoDevo for example, but it stays on the surface of things and I would recommend reading <em>Endless Forms Most Beautiful</em> (by the same author!) instead. On top of the evolution stuff you also have a random sprinkling of skeptic-related causes (dull and cringey rants about chiropractors), plus a very generic liberal environmentalism which basically ignores everything the author had written up to that point. Probably more interesting as a marker of a (short, but memorable) era than a book about DNA and evolution.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Moon-Sixpence-W-Somerset-Maugham/dp/1420951920?crid=16UV8LV22D3JX&keywords=the+moon+and+sixpence+maugham&qid=1665069460&refresh=1&s=books&sprefix=the+moon+and+sixpence+maugh%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C189&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=90e8462720590f04aee4066966d9ef4d&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Moon and Sixpence</a></strong> by Somerset W. Maugham. A fictionalized retelling of the life of Paul Gaugin, as a middle-aged English man abandons his family to go be a painter in Paris (and eventually Tahiti). I wasn&#39;t convinced by the central character, and there&#39;s nothing to this novel beyond him. The &quot;egotistic, single-minded genius&quot; trope has been done much better elsewhere, and the novel really strays very far from the actual life of Gaugin.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Golden-Bowl-Penguin-Classics/dp/0141441275?crid=3HSYOVV9PVF58&keywords=The+Golden+Bowl&qid=1665069486&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIzLjQ5IiwicXNhIjoiMy4xMSIsInFzcCI6IjMuMTAifQ%3D%3D&s=books&sprefix=the+golden+bowl%2Cstripbooks%2C519&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=159de31c121822be325f8304677b23e9&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Golden Bowl</a></strong> by Henry James.

An unstructured mishmash of warmed-over pop science and a cavalcade of bad arguments around abduction, philosophy of science, intelligence, infinity, qualia, etc. The arguments<br>about superhuman general intelligence not being possible because humans are universal Turing machines are utterly absurd and could be added verbatim to &quot;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10987" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On the Impossibility of Supersized Machines</a>&quot;. One of the worst treatments of abduction in the history of philosophy, and that&#39;s really saying something. Deutsch&#39;s comments on heritability are downright idiotic, and it&#39;s clear that he didn&#39;t even bother spending 30 seconds reading the wikipedia page. He just makes stuff up (incorrectly).

A standard tale of a British explorer somehow making himself accepted and comfortable among the primitive natives (look up Thesiger&#39;s pics), and bemoaning the disappearance of their way of life. This particular one, among the pastoral tribes of the marshes of southern Iraq. Perhaps what makes it unique is that it is set not in the 19th century, but in the late 1950s.

Lives up to its reputation. Fascinating observations on law, politics, psychology, sociology, America&#39;s Westward expansion, and more. Prefigures Timur Kuran in many ways. Incredibly prescient. Interesting both in terms of what has stayed the same since it was written, but also for a look at all that has changed. &quot;The French lawyer is simply a man extensively acquainted with the statutes of his country; but the English or American lawyer resembles the hierophants of Egypt, for like them he is the sole interpreter of an occult science.&quot;</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://sylviaioannoufoundation.org/en/collection/digital-library/b0077/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Memoirs of the Baron de Tott, on the Turks and the Tartars</a></strong>, by the Baron de Tott. Found through <a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2020/01/31/reading-notes-civilization-capitalism/">Braudel</a>. Written just a few decades before <em>Democracy in America</em>, the Baron de Tott went East instead of West. And instead of seeing the future, he saw the past. Roughly at the time the American revolution was happening, the same time when Johnson and Boswell were drinking too much claret at the Mitre, de Tott was joining the Crimean Tatars on a slave raid into Southern Russia. Most fascinating for its observations of Ottoman society, and the role de Tott played in the Russo-Turkish war of &#39;68-&#39;74. Somewhat niche and obviously nowhere near as insightful as <em>Democracy in America</em>, but definitely worth a read if this is your kind of thing. What causes the fall of empires? Culture, Tott says: all decay ultimately comes from within.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Collapse-Complex-Societies-Studies-Archaeology/dp/052138673X?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1656875629&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=e4415259732dc12daf416a9d755cdc6b&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Collapse of Complex Societies</a></strong>, by Joseph Tainter. Tainter&#39;s theory mostly comes down to decreasing marginal returns to additional societal complexity, which eventually leads to collapse. Parts of it are highly reminiscent of Chaisson&#39;s Energy-Rate Density paper (which everyone should read), but much more limited in scope. He&#39;s too focused on explaining everything with a single theory, leaving little room for contingency in history. He ignores the aspect of time: just because a system works well for 10 years does not mean it can work for 1000. And he treats rulers as being virtually unconstrained in their policy choices. </p><p>The examples he marshals in support of this theory are not particularly convincing, and (at least in some cases like the Western Roman Empire), the Mancur Olson view which focuses on public choice issues (which Tainter pretty much dismisses out of hand) seems like a vastly better fit to me. Especially when it comes to contemporary society, the examples Tainter brings up seem like a slam dunk in favor of Olson and <em>against</em> Tainter! Take education for example: is it really plausible that the ballooning costs and declining efficiency of educational spending over the past few decades is due to increased complexity? Of course not, it&#39;s clearly an issue of special interest groups with socially misaligned incentives. Tainter misses it because he never actually dives into the details of exactly <em>how</em> increased complexity is supposed to be working to produce all these effects.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Machiavellians-Defenders-Freedom-James-Burnham/dp/1839013958?crid=7IHHZKKW9G45&keywords=The+Machiavellians%3A+Defenders+of+Freedom&qid=1656875701&sprefix=%2Caps%2C1830&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=1b409a8a9e670a9c6848a98ee69275d4&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Machiavellians: Defenders of Freedom</a></strong>, by James Burnham. On Machiavelli and some of his successors: Mosca, Sorel, Michels, Pareto. Published in 1943 and it shows. Strong on the general ideas about the objective treatment of power and politics, divorced from sentimentality and moralizing. Pretty weak on the specifics. I was expecting something deeper based on its reputation. A bit dull overall.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sartor-Resartus-Oxford-Worlds-Classics/dp/0199540373?crid=2IS1K5TBELZTY&keywords=sartor+resartus&qid=1656875754&sprefix=sartor+resartu%2Caps%2C217&sr=8-2&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=57a826bcd749eb20f47f1d7833757f7e&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sartor Resartus</a></strong>, by Thomas Carlyle. Borges mentions that it inspired him to read German philosophy and that&#39;s how it ended up on my list. What can I even say about this crazy book? Carlyle invents a fictional German philosopher, who has written a treatise on clothing, and then also invents a fictional English editor who tries to explain the German philosopher&#39;s work, which turns out to be a philosophy of <em>everything</em>. Layer upon layer of irony and postmodern misdirection, and that outrageous Carlylean 19th century style to top it off. Heavily influenced by Tristram Shandy. Surprisingly influential (especially in America), though I&#39;m really not sure how seriously one is meant to take the ideas presented within.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Liftoff-Desperate-Early-Launched-SpaceX/dp/0062979981?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1656875669&sr=8-2&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=9d62ea58cf935deb698c9b7a593c2eec&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Liftoff: Elon Musk and the Desperate Early Days That Launched SpaceX</a></strong>, by Eric Berger. Fast-paced and exciting, mostly based on insider interviews, <em>Liftoff</em> gives a good idea of what the crazy early years were like at SpaceX. Once they start launching the Falcon 9 it skips over a decade in a few paragraphs, which kind of sucks. If you were wondering exactly what factors made SpaceX succeed where everyone else has failed, you will probably come away from the book disappointed. Still, recommended.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apollo-Race-Moon-Charles-Murray/dp/0671611011?crid=1LJ2PVBNPAG83&keywords=Apollo%3A+The+Race+to+the+Moon&qid=1656875826&sprefix=apollo+the+race+to+the+moon%2Caps%2C229&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=c8237fd431cab063cd44dcf0f99dcf43&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apollo: The Race to the Moon</a></strong>, by Charles Murray (yes, that Charles Murray). One of the better Apollo books, this one is focused mostly on the bureaucratic aspects with a few glimpses into engineering as well. At 500 pages it still feels far too short, as some major events and personalities are given very little space. Overall very strong, and it&#39;s truly astonishing how there was almost nothing at all in terms of the space program in 1960, how young everyone was, how nobody really knew what they were doing, etc. For some reason it seems to be out of print.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Book-That-Changed-Europe-Ceremonies/dp/0674049284?crid=1VJ1HKXWJJ7OA&keywords=The+Book+That+Changed+Europe%3A+Picart+%26+Bernard%27s+Religious+Ceremonies+of+the+World&qid=1656875880&sprefix=the+book+that+changed+europe+picart+%26+bernard%27s+religious+ceremonies+of+the+world%2Caps%2C527&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=c9329ec14c7643849b0c6c715feaa6a1&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Book That Changed Europe: Picart &amp; Bernard&#39;s Religious Ceremonies of the World</a></strong>, by Lynn Hunt. The story of the publication of the titular book, and a look at the religious environment of the 18th century. Freethinking Protestant refugees congregate in cosmopolitan Amsterdam and make waves through their printing presses. Fascinating subject, terrible execution. Unorganized, repetitive, badly written, and filled with pointless digressions. There&#39;s an irrelevant digression in the very first paragraph of the book! Maybe if a competent editor had gone to town on it...Also, I think the authors wildly overrate the book&#39;s ultimate importance.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Distant-Mirror-Calamitous-14th-Century/dp/0345349571?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1656875976&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=c2eb45df85d2b177c401f53a133d7af4&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Distant Mirror: The Calamitous 14th Century</a></strong>, by Barbara Tuchman. Audiobook. A look at 14th century Europe, mostly as it was seen from the perspective of the French nobleman Enguerrand VII de Coucy. Mainly based on the Chronicles of Froissart. Plague, the 100 years&#39; war, religious fanaticism, popes and antipopes, peasant revolts, crusades, etc. Very entertaining, but it sacrifices quite a lot of rigor to get there. Too many blatantly false statements from the 14th century are taken at face value. And there&#39;s more than a bit of Monty Python about this: at points, I thought I discerned the distant—but unmistakable—beat of coconuts in the background of the audiobook. This sentence gives you the vibe: &quot;A decision was perforce taken to march straight through the dark, fobidding forest of the Ardennes, where, Froissart remarks with awed inaccuracy, &quot;no traveler had ever before passed.&quot;&quot;</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Project-Hail-Mary/dp/B08GB58KD5?crid=2ABDDWPC70P7R&keywords=Project+Hail+Mary&qid=1656876022&sprefix=project+hail+mary%2Caps%2C275&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=948c157e23e8b2e1c43436e5358596b9&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project Hail Mary</a></strong>, by Andy Weir.

Newstok. A Romantic old-man-yells-at-clouds tirade about modern education practices. It didn&#39;t change any of my views, but it didn&#39;t really attempt to do so in the first place: Newstok is a reformist, while I am strictly an abolitionist—and therefore far outside the target audience. I find it hard to separate mass education from the commoditization of knowledge, while Newstok believes we can have our cake and eat it too. In any case, if you want a passionate argument in favor of high-quality education interspersed with Shakespeare quotes, this is the book for you.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Frank-Herberts-Dune-3-Book-Boxed/dp/0593201892?crid=3U4MMQO42NODF&keywords=dune+herbert&qid=1649063077&sprefix=dune+he%2Caps%2C317&sr=8-3&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=0d077bc42ee5ecc5eb58e4cf6902769e&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dune</a></strong>, by Frank Herbert. Pretty great, Herbert constructs a deeply alluring world which pulls you in despite some rather hilariously implausible aspects. It&#39;s interesting how so much of the &quot;plot&quot; actually happens in the background. The audiobook is quite good.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Frank-Herberts-Dune-3-Book-Boxed/dp/0593201892?crid=3U4MMQO42NODF&keywords=dune+herbert&qid=1649063077&sprefix=dune+he%2Caps%2C317&sr=8-3&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=0d077bc42ee5ecc5eb58e4cf6902769e&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dune Messiah</a></strong>, by Frank Herbert. I was told the sequels get crazy, and this is a pretty good start in that direction! Can&#39;t wait to see where this nonsense ends up. This is basically a book of palace intrigue and scheming, with a rich religious/predestination/weird time loop sauce on top. </li><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Star-Maker-Olaf-Stapledon/dp/0486466833?crid=1YV5UG2XWKK7U&keywords=star+maker&qid=1649063124&sprefix=star%2Caps%2C941&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=1ee0aedc2c6127e7caf250f857164658&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Star Maker</a></strong>, by Olaf Stapledon. I kept thinking that it felt like a really weird throwback to the 1920s-30s, then I looked it up and it was written in 1937. Whoops. It&#39;s a non-stop torrent of interesting science fiction ideas, but there&#39;s no continuity, no characters to latch on to, and the examination of the ideas stays at the surface level. It&#39;s just a series of &quot;this happened, then this happened, then this happened&quot; which I found rather boring.</li><li><strong><a href>The Island of Doctor Death and Other Stories and Other Stories</a></strong>, by Gene Wolfe. Some fantastic stories in this collection, in particular I loved Feather Tigers, Death of Dr. Island, Toy Theater, and Seven American Nights. Many of them are in that classic Wolfe style where you have to piece together what&#39;s going on from tiny hints left in the text, and it&#39;s all a bit ambiguous in the end and so on. There&#39;s a lot of focus on religion and death (with two stories, <em>The Hero as Werwolf</em> and <em>The Doctor of Death Island</em>, being fairly explicitly death-ist).</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Orphans-Sky-Robert-Heinlein/dp/0671318454?crid=188W5DP34R9LB&keywords=orphans+of+the+sky&qid=1649063511&sprefix=orphans+of+the+s%2Caps%2C234&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=a8feb1e2dba52cbe188fbee2263df408&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Orphans of the Sky</a></strong>, by Robert Heinlein. Fairly standard generation ship story. Juvenile and ham-fisted (there&#39;s a scene where the protagonist literally yells out &quot;and yet it moves!&quot;). Mutants and knife fights and all that. 12 year old me would&#39;ve loved it.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wittgensteins-Nephew-Novel-Vintage-International/dp/1400077567?keywords=Wittgenstein%27s+Nephew&qid=1649063536&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=525837e06e74e8fca7b0c3fac02b6702&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wittgenstein&#39;s Nephew</a></strong>, by Thomas Bernhard. Bernhard documents his friendship with Paul Wittgenstein (not the pianist), a black sheep of the Wittgenstein family who suffered from various mental problems. They&#39;re both rejected by Austrian society, and they both reject it. Bernhard&#39;s attitude toward awards (he views them as a kind of insult and punishment) really sums up his relation to his country. A bitter book, sad and pathetic and miserly. Recommended if you&#39;re in the market for a feel-bad memoir.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Status-Game-Human-Life-Play/dp/0008354677?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1649063638&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=1e79a2cc8525d392bb7e1bee453a5e01&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Status Game: On Social Position and How We Use It</a></strong>, by Will Storr. There&#39;s quite a bit of overlap with <em>The Elephant in the Brain</em>, but Storr&#39;s book is obviously more focused on status. Also reminiscent of Goffman&#39;s <em>Presentation of Self in Everyday Life</em>. Lots of references to Boehm, Henrich, Kuran, Wrangham, etc. (You&#39;re probably better off going straight to the source?) If I had to choose between this and <em>Elephant</em> I&#39;d go for <em>Elephant</em>, but they&#39;re fairly complementary so it won&#39;t be a waste of your time to read both. Parts of the book are focused on contemporary culture war issues, which felt a bit shallow and tiresome. Overall it&#39;s not bad though.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Biology-Systems-Evolutionary-Foundations-Behavior-ebook/dp/B075GYH7JR?crid=1CR2WVWXBQ8DU&keywords=The+Biology+of+Moral+System&qid=1649063705&sprefix=the+biology+of+moral+system%2Caps%2C364&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=7210b68ae2e2ba13658a11526f0c3e10&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Biology of Moral Systems</a></strong>, by Richard Alexander. There&#39;s a great core here, but I wouldn&#39;t recommend it. The basic idea of approaching moral systems from an evopsych perspective is useful. However, huge swathes of text are wasted on dull and low-quality academic bickering, many of the specifics (eg the arguments on the development of religion) are completely off, and the last third of the book is dedicated to a mostly fruitless discussion of nuclear war and mutually assured destruction.<div class="subscribediv" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:250px;margin-top:30px;"><form class="validate" action="https://fantasticanachronism.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=2a6ff66ec7039625cb12680d5&amp;amp;id=f713c1306c" method="post" id="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" target="_blank"><div class="mc-field-group"><input class="required email" type="email" name="EMAIL" id="mce-EMAIL" placeholder="Type your email..." value></div><div class="clear" id="mce-responses"><div class="respose" id="mce-error-response" style="display:none"></div><div class="respose" id="mce-success-response" style="display:none"></div></div><div style="position: absolute; left: -5000px" aria-hidden="true"><input type="text" name="b_2a6ff66ec7039625cb12680d5_f713c1306c" tabindex="-1" value></div><div class="clear"><input type="submit" value="Subscribe" name="subscribe" id="mc-embedded-subscribe" clas="button"></div></form></div></li></ul>]]></content>

Battutah was born in Morocco; he was not wealthy, but he was well-educated and went into the family business of Islamic law. At age 21, he set out for the pilgrimage to Mecca. He would extend his journey for decades, however, following traders in ships and caravans, relying on generous Muslim institutions and his talent for befriending rulers. He eventually covered virtually the entire Islamic world and beyond, from North Africa to China.</p><p>Battutah gets into all sorts of adventures (luckily escaping death by disease, shipwreck, pirates, bandits, and so on) and provides us with some incredible ethnographic observations. In Constantinople, he meets the Emperor. In India, he becomes a prominent and wealthy administrator under the rule of an erratic Sultan. In the Maldives, he marries six local women and lives a life of leisure under the shade of the palm trees. Yet his wanderlust compels him to keep moving. Battutah himself as a person, however, remains tantalizingly obscure.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Having divorced my wives I set sail. We came to a little island in the archipelago in which there was but one house, occupied by a weaver. He had a wife and family, a few coco-palms and a small boat, with which he used to fish and to cross over to any of the islands he wished to visit. His island contained also banana bushes, but we saw no land birds on it except two crows, which came out to us on our arrival and circled above our vessel. And I swear I envied that man, and wished that the island had been mine, that I might have made it my retreat until the inevitable hour should befall me. </p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both;"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/bb21_libra.jpg" class="floatright nofancybox"><p>Don DeLillo, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Libra-Contemporary-American-Fiction-DeLillo/dp/0140156046?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1642242862&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=ab64c1da21e6e03ca9ee8abd68d744f3&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Libra</strong></a></p><p>A semi-fictionalized biography of Lee Harvey Oswald in the Oliver Stone tradition, suffused with that great DeLillo style. There&#39;s also a kind of meta parallel story of an FBI agent trying to piece together all the evidence, meticulously going through even the tiniest element (much like DeLillo himself). It&#39;s quite Pynchonesque with all the criss-crossing conspiracies, the CIA, paranoia, axes of control and influence, a series of coincidences, taking liberty with history...and the ultimately mysterious &quot;fate&quot; that brought Oswald to the assassination. It lacks Pynchon&#39;s humor though.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>&quot;I don&#39;t know what they want me to do.&quot; &quot;Of course you know.&quot; &quot;Tell me where it happens.&quot; &quot;Miami.&quot; &quot;That means nothing to me.&quot; &quot;You&#39;ve known for weeks.&quot; &quot;What happens in Miami?&quot; Ferrie took a while to finish chewing his food. &quot;Think of two parallel lines,&quot; he said. &quot;One is the life of Lee H. Oswald. One is the conspiracy to kill the President. What bridges the space between them? What makes a connection inevitable? There is a third line. It comes out of dreams, visions, intuitions, prayers, out of the deepest levels of the self. It&#39;s not generated by cause and effect like the other two lines. It&#39;s a line that cuts across causality, cuts across time. It has no history that we can recognize or understand. But it forces a connection. It puts a man on the path of his destiny.&quot;</p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both;"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/bb21_manuscripts.jpg" class="floatleft nofancybox"><p>Christopher de Hamel, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Meetings-Remarkable-Manuscripts-Journeys-Medieval/dp/1594206112?keywords=meetings+with+remarkable+manuscripts&qid=1642245167&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=a8c4aa7e16c34acad2b8630aaae25f43&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Meetings with Remarkable Manuscripts: Twelve Journeys into the Medieval World</strong></a></p><p>Twelve chapters, each one dedicated to a different medieval manuscript, from the 6th century Gospels of St. Augustine to the 16th century Spinola Book of Hours. The book is filled with fantastic, gorgeous, high-quality prints from these manuscripts, interspersed with history and commentary in a pleasant conversational style. It&#39;s not just about the manuscripts themselves, but also who owned them, their condition, how they&#39;ve been maintained or altered, where they&#39;re housed, and the people taking care of them. Cultural differences in library regulatory practices are a virtually infinite source of comedy. Just lovely all around. Make sure you get the hardcover as the paperback is apparently printed in black &amp; white.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Confirmation that he was indeed both scribe and artist is found in the shape of the spaces left for the insertion of initials. Both scribes 2 and 3 (let us exclude 1 for the moment) left simple rectangular blank spaces where large initials were to be painted later, without thought to their shape or composition, and they added guidewords in the margins to indicate what letters were to be supplied. When Hugo came to fill them in, his flamboyantly fluid and multi-tentacled initials fitted uncomfortably into these big draughty square apertures. However, during the stint written by the last scribe from folio 185v onwards, the edges of the script are moulded line by line to fit around the curves and limbs of the painted initials, nestling together snugly like a newly married couple in bed. Text and decoration must have been executed simultaneously by the same person. In short, scribe 4 must be Hugo. </p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both;"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/bb21_vonneumann.jpg" class="floatright nofancybox"><p>Ananyo Bhattacharya, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-Man-from-the-Future/dp/0241398851?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1642245503&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=3d0b5206a2f6312ddde77541a9f4a088&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Man From the Future: The Visionary Life of John von Neumann</a></strong></p><p>Short, dense, and with a great balance between accessibility and dumbing down complex subjects. Bhattacharya approaches his subject by focusing on ideas. The first chapter takes care of JvN&#39;s early life, and the rest of the book is split up based on the subjects he worked on: mathematics, quantum mechanics, the nuclear bomb, computing, game theory, RAND, and artificial life. Large parts of the book (I&#39;d say about a third) are dedicated not to von Neumann but rather the work other people did based on his ideas. The game theory chapter, for example, covers Nash, Schelling, Aumann, etc. in economics, and John Maynard Smith, Price, Hamilton, etc. in evolutionary game theory. Bhattacharya is good at making all these technical subjects accessible without dumbing them down too much. The one failing point is that JvN&#39;s personality, personal life, and professional relationships don&#39;t get much attention.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>From 1944, meetings instigated by Norbert Wiener helped to focus von Neumann’s thinking about brains and computers. In gatherings of the short-lived ‘Teleological Society’, and later in the ‘Conferences on Cybernetics’, von Neumann was at the heart of discussions on how the brain or computing machines generate ‘purposive behaviour’. Busy with so many other things, he would whizz in, lecture for an hour or two on the links between information and entropy or circuits for logical reasoning, then whizz off again – leaving the bewildered attendees to discuss the implications of whatever he had said for the rest of the afternoon. Listening to von Neumann talk about the logic of neuro-anatomy, one scientist declared, was like ‘hanging on to the tail of a kite’.

Somewhat gossipy and often inaccurate, it nonetheless remains our best source of information on the art and artists of Renaissance Italy. Vasari was a fairly successful painter himself, and his personal aquaintance with both the technique and the business of painting gives us an inside view of the craft. <a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/09/17/book-review-the-lives-of-the-most-excellent-painters-sculptors-and-architects/">Full review</a>.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>It is clear that Leonardo, through his comprehension of art, began many things and never finished one of them, since it seemed to him that the hand was not able to attain to the perfection of art in carrying out the things which he imagined; for the reason that he conceived in idea difficulties so subtle and so marvellous, that they could never be expressed by the hands, be they ever so excellent. And so many were his caprices, that, philosophizing of natural things, he set himself to seek out the properties of herbs, going on even to observe the motions of the heavens, the path of the moon, and the courses of the sun. </p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both;"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/bb21_schopenhauer.jpg" class="floatright nofancybox"><p>Arthur Schopenhauer, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Essays-Aphorisms-Penguin-Classics-Schopenhauer/dp/0140442278?crid=2ZB9Z9X10IUAJ&keywords=essays+and+aphorisms&qid=1642355269&sprefix=essays+and+aphori%2Caps%2C255&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=4c0505288b85624ec5cfbbfb07dc4ee5&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Essays and Aphorisms</strong></a></p><p>Excerpts from <em>Parerga und Paralipomena</em>.

In any case, while reading this, one must always keep in mind that the Athenians <em>lost</em>!</p><p>It&#39;s interesting to read an ancient historian write about battles with 60 hoplites and 20 archers, and that kind of accounting accuracy perfectly captures Thuc&#39;s personality.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>&quot;...

Rather, the admiration of the present and succeeding ages will be ours, since we have not left our power without witness, but have shown it by mighty proofs; and far from needing a Homer for our eulogist, or other of his craft whose verses might charm for the moment only for the impression which they gave to melt at the touch of fact, we have forced every sea and land to be the highway of our daring, and everywhere, whether for evil or for good, have left imperishable monuments behind us.

An incredibly rich dish that you can only eat so much of before needing to take a break. Reflects and contains nature both in its form and content. Somewhat reminiscent of Urne-Buriall in that it starts out in a dry, scientific tone and then reaches stylistic extremes later on.</p><p>Famously recommended by Werner Herzog (along with Virgil and <em>The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber</em>), and it is indeed extremely Herzogian.

Five minutes he stayed there, fixed like a barb in the blue flesh of the sky. His body was still and rigid, his head turned from side to side, his tail fanned open and shut, his wings whipped and shuddered like canvas in the lash of the wind. He side-slipped to his left, paused, then glided round and down into what could only be the beginning of a tremendous stoop. There is no mistaking the menace of that first easy drifting fall. Smoothly, at an angle of fifty degrees, he descended; not slowly, but controlling his speed; gracefully, beautifully balanced. There was no abrupt change. The angle of his fall became gradually steeper till there was no angle left, but only a perfect arc. He curved over and slowly revolved, as though for delight, glorying in anticipation of the dive to come. His feet opened and gleamed golden, clutching up towards the sun. He rolled over, and they dulled, and turned towards the ground beneath, and closed again. For a thousand feet he fell, and curved, and slowly turned, and tilted upright. Then his speed increased, and he dropped vertically down. He had another thousand feet to fall, but now he fell sheer, shimmering down through dazzling sunlight, heart-shaped, like a heart in flames. He became smaller and darker, diving down from the sun. The partridge in the snow beneath looked up at the black heart dilating down upon him, and heard a hiss of wings rising to a roar. In ten seconds the hawk was down, and the whole splendid fabric, the arched reredos and immense fan-vaulting of his flight, was consumed and lost in the fiery maelstrom of the sky.</p><p>And for the partridge there was the sun suddenly shut out, the foul flailing blackness spreading wings above, the roar ceasing, the blazing knives driving in, the terrible white face descending, hooked and masked and horned and staring-eyed. And then the back-breaking agony beginning, and snow scattering from scuffling feet, and show filling the bill’s wide silent scream, till the merciful needle of the hawk’s beak notched in the straining neck and jerked the shuddering life away.</p><p>And for the hawk, resting now on the soft flaccid bulk of his prey, there was the rip and tear of choking feathers, and hot blood dripping from the hook of his beak, and rage dying slowly to a small hard core within.</p><p>And for the watcher, sheltered for centuries from such hunger and such rage, such agony and such fear, there is the memory of that sabring fall from the sky, and the vicarious joy of the guiltless hunter who kills only through his familiar, and wills him to be fed. </p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both;"></div><h1 id="The-Worst"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2022/03/04/the-best-and-worst-books-i-read-in-2021/#The-Worst" class="headerlink" title="The Worst"></a>The Worst</h1><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/bb21_hazlitt.jpg" class="floatleft nofancybox"><p>William Hazlitt, <strong>Selected Writings</strong></p><p>I despise the style of his political writings.

But then a question is started, as if the persons asking it were at a great loss for the answer,—Where are we to find the intellect of the people? Why, all the intellect that ever was is theirs. The public opinion expresses not only the collective sense of the whole people, but of all ages and nations, of all those minds that have devoted themselves to the love of truth and the good of mankind,—who have bequeathed their instructions, their hopes, and their example to posterity,—who have thought, spoke, written, acted, and suffered in the name and on the behalf of our common nature.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In <em>Averroës&#39;s Search</em>, Borges tells the story of the Islamic philosopher Averroës trying, and failing, to understand Aristotle&#39;s writings on theater. Borges sums it up in the afterword:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>In the preceding tale, I have tried to narrate the process of failure, the process of defeat. I thought first of that archbishop of Canterbury who set himself the task of proving that God exists; then I thought of the alchemists who sought the philosopher’s stone; then, of he vain trisectors of the angle and squares of the circle. Then I reflected that a more poetic case than these would be a man who sets himself a goal that is not forbidden to other men, but is forbidden to him. I recalled Averroës, who, bounded within the circle of Islam, could never know the meaning of the words tragedy and comedy.</p></div></blockquote><p>History and literature offer many cases of ironically failed quests for knowledge. </p><p>Some phenomena disappear immediately once someone describes them. Douglas Adams wrote of a theory &quot;which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear&quot;. The modern world offers many such <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/11/the-phatic-and-the-anti-inductive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-inductive</a> cases, above all in the movements of the stock market: successful trading strategies tend to stop working after they become known. On a civilizational scale, Malthusianism became irrelevant right at the time someone was able to articulate the idea, and it seems that the moment we are able to improve ourselves through genetic engineering, we will be wiped out by our artificial creations.</p><!-- eroom --><p>A second type of ill-fated seeker is one who finds what he is looking for, but his goal is also a punishment. William Beckford, categorically rejecting Ulysses&#39; actions at the land of the Sirens (perhaps inspired by his own life, and perhaps commenting on all attempts to comprehend the universe) created the apostate Caliph Vathek whose obsessive quest for knowledge results in his damnation, and for whom Hell is both the object of desire and the punishment for that desire. There are those who argue that the libertine Beckford only adopted this biblical attitude against the Faustian spirit as an ironic orientalist façade, but the Caliph resists all attempts at interpretation.</p><!-- Such was, and such should be, the punishment of unrestrained  passions, and atrocious actions. Such is, and such should be, the  chastisement of blind ambition, that would transgress those bounds which the Creator hath prescribed to human knowledge, and by aiming at  discoveries reserved for pure intelligence, acquire that infatuated  pride, which perceives not the condition appointed to man is, to be ignorant and humble. --><p>Some seekers reach their goal, only to have it slip out of their hands. Scientists will occasionally chance on the right idea but lack the ability to prove it: Aristarchus of Samos was doomed by the apparent size of the stars and the lack of parallax. The Royal Navy discovered that lemons prevent scurvy, and then through terrible epistemic luck managed to <a href="https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2022/01/11/reality-is-very-weird-and-you-need-to-be-prepared-for-that/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lose that knowledge</a> over the course of the 19th century: lemons were replaced by limes low in vitamin C, but nobody noticed because the ships were faster. The problem only reappeared when polar explorers started suffering from scurvy despite bringing lime juice with them—and the answer was only discovered by the miraculously good luck of experimenting on guinea pigs, one of very few animals that don&#39;t produce vitamin C on their own.</p><p>Finally the most ironic case of them all, that of the Dalmatian archbishop and heretic Marco Antonio de Dominis: a seeker who is able to find the answer, but is condemned to believe it is false. De Dominis, a contemporary of Kepler (who wrote in favor of the lunar theory of tides) and Galileo (who mocked it), was also an amateur astronomer and wrote a book on the tides titled <em>Euripus</em>. </p><p>The archbishop begins by presenting both empirical and theoretical arguments in favor of the thesis that the earth is a sphere. He then describes the luni-solar theory of tides: he (correctly) writes that tides are caused by the combined gravitational action of the sun and the moon, (correctly) predicts that high tide occurs simultaneously at antipodal points, and (correctly) shows that the cycle of spring and neap tides can be explained by the combined action of the sun and moon. He also (correctly) deduces that the diurnal inequality between tides will be greatest when the moon is above the tropic of Cancer or Capricorn. Finally, de Dominis explains (incorrectly) that since the two daily tides are always equal to each other, the theory must be false. The heretical archbishop died behind the bars of the Castel Sant&#39;Angelo before his book could be published.</p><div class="subscribediv" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:250px;margin-top:30px;"><form class="validate" action="https://fantasticanachronism.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=2a6ff66ec7039625cb12680d5&amp;amp;id=f713c1306c" method="post" id="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" target="_blank"><div class="mc-field-group"><input class="required email" type="email" name="EMAIL" id="mce-EMAIL" placeholder="Type your email..." value></div><div class="clear" id="mce-responses"><div class="respose" id="mce-error-response" style="display:none"></div><div class="respose" id="mce-success-response" style="display:none"></div></div><div style="position: absolute; left: -5000px" aria-hidden="true"><input type="text" name="b_2a6ff66ec7039625cb12680d5_f713c1306c" tabindex="-1" value></div><div class="clear"><input type="submit" value="Subscribe" name="subscribe" id="mc-embedded-subscribe" clas="button"></div></form></div>]]></content>

Small groups of these superforecasters are as accurate as academic respondents.</p></div></blockquote><h3 id="Economic-History"><a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2022/01/04/links-and-what-ive-been-reading-q4-2021/#Economic-History" class="headerlink" title="Economic History"></a>Economic History</h3><p>11&#x2E; The United Fruit Company? <a href="https://1ac50a88-25ab-4011-94bc-c9af1856189b.filesusr.com/ugd/27755d_d7f7e7743b6140689b61e724692ec872.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Good, Actually</a>.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Using administrative census data with census-block geo-references from 1973 to 2011, we implement a geographic regression discontinuity design that exploits a land assignment that is orthogonal to our outcomes of interest.

Bhattacharya approaches his subject by focusing on ideas. The first chapter takes care of JvN&#39;s early life, and the rest of the book is split up based on the subjects he worked on: mathematics, quantum mechanics, the nuclear bomb, computing, game theory, RAND, and artificial life. Large parts of the book (I&#39;d say about a third) are dedicated not to von Neumann but rather the work other people did based on his ideas. The game theory chapter, for example, covers Nash, Schelling, Aumann, etc. in economics, and John Maynard Smith, Price, Hamilton, etc. in evolutionary game theory. Bhattacharya is good at making all these technical subjects accessible without dumbing them down too much. JvN&#39;s personality, personal life, professional relationships, etc. on the other hand are given scant attention.</p><p>Overall it felt a bit too short. In less than 300 pages we get such a wide array of ideas, and the story of how they influenced so many people, that it often feels like we&#39;re just skimming the surface in a speedboat. I&#39;d like to take a deeper, more ponderous ride in a submarine some day. </p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Meetings-Remarkable-Manuscripts-Journeys-Medieval/dp/1594206112?crid=GVG9FQDFUW1H&keywords=meetings+with+remarkable+manuscripts&qid=1641223355&sprefix=meetings+with+remarkable+manuscri%2Caps%2C193&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=7c861eed6d26fbba6cc34f5e57a55962&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meetings with Remarkable Manuscripts</a></strong> by Christopher de Hamel.

G. Sebald. A book of digressions. The frame is a walking tour of England, and on it are bolted various musings on Sir Thomas Browne, Joseph Konrad, silk manufacture, the Taiping rebellion, and so on. The subjects flow into each other so you don&#39;t know where one digression begins and the other ends. However, Sebald kind of undersells how interesting his subjects are; comparing his notes on FitzGerald to the <a href="https://www.gwern.net/docs/borges/1951-borges-theenigmaofedwardfitzgerald.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">famous Borges essay</a>, for example, makes me wonder how Sebald managed to turn such a fascinating subject into such a dull essay.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Conquistador-Hernan-Cortes-Montezuma-Aztecs/dp/0553384716?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1641224324&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=1241b9d1daaed1f4d25c01ea142d33b5&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Conquistador: Hernán Cortés, King Montezuma, and the Last Stand of the Aztecs</a></strong> by Buddy Levy. I didn&#39;t love the book (it felt a bit sloppy, and the style isn&#39;t great), but Cortes is an incredible character. The determination, the ingenuity, the absolute ruthlesness. When he murders his wife at the end of the book, all you can think is &quot;well of course he did&quot;. And self-aware too: &quot;I and my companions suffer from a disease of the heart that can be cured only with gold&quot;! Perhaps it is the contrast against the Aztecs that, in a way, softens his image?

Covers the entire thing plus a ton of backstory, very thorough (within its scope). Focused on the astronauts, and much of it is the preoduct of interviews with those astronauts, which is kind of obvious at many points as you&#39;re only getting one person&#39;s perspective on certain events. It would have been better with a broader, more objective view, in my opinion. The latter parts (after the first moon landing) include a surprising amount of geology! I read three books on the early space program this year and none of them was completely satisfying, I&#39;m still trying to find the Richard Rhodes of Apollo...</p></li></ul><div class="subscribediv" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:250px;margin-top:30px;"><form class="validate" action="https://fantasticanachronism.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=2a6ff66ec7039625cb12680d5&amp;amp;id=f713c1306c" method="post" id="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" target="_blank"><div class="mc-field-group"><input class="required email" type="email" name="EMAIL" id="mce-EMAIL" placeholder="Type your email..." value></div><div class="clear" id="mce-responses"><div class="respose" id="mce-error-response" style="display:none"></div><div class="respose" id="mce-success-response" style="display:none"></div></div><div style="position: absolute; left: -5000px" aria-hidden="true"><input type="text" name="b_2a6ff66ec7039625cb12680d5_f713c1306c" tabindex="-1" value></div><div class="clear"><input type="submit" value="Subscribe" name="subscribe" id="mc-embedded-subscribe" clas="button"></div></form></div>]]></content>
