The final paragraph reads:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Then English and French and mere Spanish will disappear from the globe. The world will be Tlön. I pay no attention to all this and go on revising, in the still days at the Adrogue hotel, an uncertain Quevedian translation (which I do not intend to publish) of Browne&#39;s <em>Urn Burial</em>.</p></div></blockquote><p>Who&#39;s Browne? What is <em>Urn Burial</em>? And what does it have to do with the story?</p><p><strong>Browne &amp; <em>Urne-Buriall</em></strong></p><p>Sir Thomas Browne was born in 1605, died in 1682, and was trained as a doctor but is remembered mostly as a writer. He coined a huge number of words including &quot;cryptography&quot;, &quot;electricity&quot;, &quot;holocaust&quot;, &quot;suicide&quot;, and &quot;ultimate&quot;. He personally embodied the transition from the Renaissance to the Enlightenment—a skeptical polymath with an interest in science, he published <em>Pseudodoxia Epidemica</em>, a book that refuted all sorts of popular superstitions. At the same time he believed in witches, alchemy, and astrology.</p><p><em>Hydriotaphia, Urne-Buriall, or, a Discourse of the Sepulchrall Urnes lately found in Norfolk</em> is his most influential work.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn894883291" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref894883291">1</sup></a></span> On the occasion of the discovery of some ancient burial urns, he launches into an examination of funerary customs across the world and ages, various cultures&#39; ideas about death and the afterlife, and the ephemerality of posthumous fame. But the essay is mainly famous for its style rather than its content: endless sentences, over-the-top abuses of Latin, striking metaphors and imagery. It &quot;smells in every word of the sepulchre&quot;, wrote Emerson. Browne begins in a dry, almost anthropological mode:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>In a Field of old Walsingham, not many moneths past, were digged up between fourty and fifty Urnes, deposited in a dry and sandy soile, not a yard deep, nor farre from one another: Not all strictly of one figure, but most answering these described: Some containing two pounds of bones, distinguishable in skulls, ribs, jawes, thigh-bones, and teeth, with fresh impressions of their combustion.</p></div></blockquote><p>The essay then slowly escalates...</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>To be gnaw’d out of our graves, to have our sculs made drinking-bowls, and our bones turned into Pipes, to delight and sport our Enemies, are Tragicall abominations, escaped in burning Burials.</p></div></blockquote><p>...and reaches a crescendo in the final chapter:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>And therefore restlesse inquietude for the diuturnity of our memories unto present considerations seems a vanity almost out of date, and superanuated peece of folly. We cannot hope to live so long in our names as some have done in their persons, one face of Janus holds no proportion unto the other. ’Tis too late to be ambitious. The great mutations of the world are acted, our time may be too short for our designes.</p></div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>There is no antidote against the <em>Opium</em> of time, which temporally considereth all things; Our Fathers finde their graves in our short memories, and sadly tell us how we may be buried in our Survivors. Grave-stones tell truth scarce fourty years: Generations passe while some trees stand, and old Families last not three Oaks. To be read by bare Inscriptions like many in <em>Gruter</em>, to hope for Eternity by Ænigmaticall Epithetes, or first letters of our names, to be studied by Antiquaries, who we were, and have new Names given us like many of the Mummies, are cold consolations unto the Students of perpetuity, even by everlasting Languages. [...] In vain we compute our felicities by the advantage of our good names, since bad have equall durations; and <em>Thersites</em> is like to live as long as <em>Agamemnon</em>. Who knows whether the best of men be known? or whether there be not more remarkable persons forgot, than any that stand remembred in the known account of time?</p></div></blockquote><p><strong>Borges &amp; Browne</strong></p><p>The ending of <em>Tlön</em> refers to a real event. When Borges and Bioy-Casares were young, they really did produce a Quevedian<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn894883292" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref894883292">2</sup></a></span> translation of Browne&#39;s <em>Urn Burial</em> which they did not publish. Browne was a significant stylistic influence on Borges, especially his &quot;baroque&quot; and &quot;labyrinthine&quot; sentences. That conspicuously unliterary word found in the famous first sentence of <em>Tlön</em>, <em>&quot;conjunction&quot;</em>, almost certainly comes from Browne. Borges explains in an interview:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>When I was a young man, I played the sedulous ape to Sir Thomas Browne. I tried to do so in Spanish. Then Adolfo Bioy-Casares and I translated the last chapter of Urn Burial into seventeenth-century Spanish—Quevedo. And it went quite well in seventeenth-century Spanish.... We did our best to be seventeenth-century, we went in for Latinisms the way that Sir Thomas Browne did. [...] I was doing my best to write Latin in Spanish.</p></div></blockquote><p>That phrase &quot;sedulous ape&quot;,<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn894883293" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref894883293">3</sup></a></span> what does that mean? Well, it&#39;s a reference to Robert Louis Stevenson (Borges was a big fan) who <em>also</em> tried to imitate Browne! In his 1887 essay collection <em>Memories and Portraits</em>, Stevenson writes:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>I have thus played the sedulous ape to Hazlitt, to Lamb, to Wordsworth, to Sir Thomas Browne, to Defoe, to Hawthorne, to Montaigne, to Baudelaire and to Obermann. I remember one of these monkey tricks, which was called The Vanity of Morals: it was to have had a second part, The Vanity of Knowledge; and as I had neither morality nor scholarship, the names were apt; but the second part was never attempted, and the first part was written (which is my reason for recalling it, ghostlike, from its ashes) no less than three times: first in the manner of Hazlitt, second in the manner of Ruskin, who had cast on me a passing spell, and third, in a laborious pasticcio of Sir Thomas Browne.</p></div></blockquote><p>In fact Browne&#39;s essay was admired by virtually all of Borges&#39;s Anglo predecessors: De Quincey, Coleridge, Dr. Johnson,<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn894883294" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref894883294">4</sup></a></span> Emerson, Poe. The epigraph of <em>The Murders in the Rue Morgue</em> is taken from <em>Urn Burial</em>: &quot;What song the Syrens sang, or what name Achilles assumed when he hid himself among women, although puzzling questions are not beyond all conjecture.&quot;</p><p><strong>Back to Tlön</strong></p><p>Let us return to the origin of this post: what does <em>Urn Burial</em> have to do with <em>Tlön</em>? Why does Borges make the reference? We can safely assume that he had a reason in mind, but the connection is not immediately obvious: Browne&#39;s essay is about funerary customs, death, and fame—there&#39;s nothing in it about idealism, alternate worlds, or the social construction of reality.</p><p>I believe the key is that Browne misattributed the urns to the Romans (they were really Anglo-Saxon and dated to ~500 AD).<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn894883295" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref894883295">5</sup></a></span> Just as the invented world of Tlön invades reality in the Borges story, so Browne&#39;s invented Roman urns (and the connection they imply between Rome and England) impose themselves on our reality. Or perhaps the connection is to the Tlönian hrönir, objects that (in that idealist universe) appear when you start looking for them. Browne looked for Roman urns and therefore found them. This perspective also recalls Borges&#39;s inventions of fictional writers.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn894883296" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref894883296">6</sup></a></span> A third and more doubtful interpretation involves Browne&#39;s mention of Tiberius, who (like Borges-the-narrator) rejected the world and withdrew to Capri, where he wrote anachronistic Greek verse and had oneiric visions inspired by ancient mythology. Or perhaps Borges simply wanted to pay tribute to his influences.</p><div class="subscribediv" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:250px;margin-top:30px"><form class="validate" action="https://fantasticanachronism.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=2a6ff66ec7039625cb12680d5&amp;amp;id=f713c1306c" method="post" id="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" target="_blank"><div class="mc-field-group"><input class="required email" type="email" name="EMAIL" id="mce-EMAIL" placeholder="Type your email..."></div><div class="clear" id="mce-responses"><div class="respose" id="mce-error-response" style="display:none"></div><div class="respose" id="mce-success-response" style="display:none"></div></div><div style="position:absolute;left:-5000px" aria-hidden="true"><input type="text" name="b_2a6ff66ec7039625cb12680d5_f713c1306c" tabindex="-1"></div><div class="clear"><input type="submit" value="Subscribe" name="subscribe" id="mc-embedded-subscribe" clas="button"></div></form></div><div id="footnotes"><hr><div id="footnotelist"><ol style="list-style:none;padding-left:0;margin-left:40px"><li id="fn894883291"><span style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;padding-right:10px;margin-left:-40px">1.</span><span><span class="footnote-contents"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Religio-Medici-Urne-Buriall-Review-Classics/dp/1590174887?dchild=1&amp;keywords=browne+nyrb&amp;qid=1612708091&amp;sr=8-1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=fantasticanch-20&amp;linkId=a20b329f9391f036742f43c104d63992&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NYRB puts out a cute little tome</a>, pairing it with his other famous essay, <em>Religio Medici</em>, a kind of Montaignian self-examination.</span><a href="#fnref894883291" rev="footnote"> ↩</a></span></li><li id="fn894883292"><span style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;padding-right:10px;margin-left:-40px">2.</span><span><span class="footnote-contents">Francisco de Quevedo (1580-1645) was a nobleman and prolific writer.

This would suggest that the very notion of a &quot;Quevedian translation&quot; of Browne is a joke in itself, as Browne was famous for his ornate and extravagant style.

Changes were first noticed in 1718 A.D. by Halley, who, probably without realizing that he was completing an experiment consciously started two thousand years earlier, recorded that his measured coordinates for Sirius, Arcturus and Aldebaran diverged noticeably from those given by Ptolemy.</p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="/images/bb20_alexandriaquartet-f63248431f59561c9a2999e5ce220c8e.jpg" class="floatright nofancybox"><p>Larence Durrell, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Alexandria-Quartet-Lawrence-Durrell/dp/0571283934/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=the+alexandria+quartet&qid=1608303691&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=d0fc708606730ef9becb01731426f2b4&language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Alexandria Quartet</a></strong></p><p>Four interconnected novels set in sensuous and decadent Alexandria in the days before World War II, focused on a loose group of foreigners drawn to and trapped by the city&#39;s pleasures.

Wanderlust, melancholy, friendship, alcohol, and heartbreak as we follow his adventures and ill-fated &quot;business ventures&quot; at the margins of civilization. It&#39;s very good at generating a vicarious pleasure in the &quot;nomadic mania&quot; of the main character and the parallel world of tramp steamers, seamen, and port city whores. Stories are told through second-hand recountings, miraculously recovered documents, or distant rumours found in exotic locales. Underlying it all there&#39;s a feeling of a fundamental dissatisfaction with what life has to offer, and Maqroll&#39;s adventures are an attempt to overcome that feeling. Stylistically rich and sumptuous, reminiscent of Conrad&#39;s maritime adventures, Herzog&#39;s diaries, and even Borges.</p><p>My favorite of the novellas involves a decaying tramp steamer and a parallel love affair (between the ship&#39;s captain and its owner) which is taken up whenever and wherever the ship goes to port, then put on hold while at sea.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>The tramp steamer entered my field of vision as slowly as a wounded saurian. I could not believe my eyes. With the wondrous splendor of Saint Petersburg in the background, the poor ship intruded on the scene, its sides covered with dirty streaks of rust and refuse that reached all the way to the waterline. The captain&#39;s bridge, and the row of cabins on the deck for crew members and occasional passengers, had been painted white a long time before. Now a coat of grime, oil, and urine gave them an indefinite color, the color of misery, of irreparable decadence, of desperate, incessant use. The chimerical freighter slipped through the water to the agonized gasp of its machinery and the irregular rhythm of driving rods that threatened at any moment to fall silent forever. Now it occupied the foreground of the serene, dreamlike spectacle that had held all my attention, and my astonished wonder turned into something extremely difficult to define. This nomadic piece of sea trash bore a kind of witness to our destiny on earth, a <em>pulvis eris</em> that seemed truer and more eloquent in these polished metal waters with the gold and white vision of the capital of the last czars behind them. The sleek outline of the buildings and wharves on the Finnish coast rose at my side. At that moment I felt the stirrings of a warm solidarity for the tramp steamer, as if it were an unfortunate brother, a victim of human neglect and greed to which it responded with a stubborn determination to keep tracing the dreary wake of its miseries on all the world&#39;s seas. I watched it move toward the interior of the bay, searching for some discreet dock where it could anchor without too many maneuvers and, perhaps, for as little money as possible. The Honduran flag hung at the stern. The final letters of the name that had almost been erased by the waves were barely visible: ...cyon. In what seemed too mocking an irony, the name of this old freighter was probably the <em>Halcyon</em>.</p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="/images/bb20_sciencefictions-235f278bd8a2416bf5e68532e40d0aba.jpg" class="floatleft nofancybox"><p>Stuart Ritchie, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Science-Fictions/dp/1847925650/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=Science+Fictions:+Exposing+Fraud,+Bias,+Negligence+and+Hype+in+Science&qid=1608303334&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=a5a155acb001602ec0e5c31a50db9ca7&language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Science Fictions: Exposing Fraud, Bias, Negligence and Hype in Science</a></strong></p><p>An excellent introduction to the replication crisis.

The perverse incentives have become so deeply embedded that they’ve created a system that’s self-sustaining. Years of implicit and explicit training to chase publications and citations at any cost leave their mark on trainee scientists, forming new norms, habits, and ways of thinking that are hard to break even once a stable job has been secured. And as we discussed in the previous chapter, the system creates a selection pressure where the only academics who survive are the ones who are naturally good at playing the game.</p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="/images/bb20_piranesi-ee3105cdda805e4281c9bbc586e70936.jpg" class="floatright nofancybox"><p>Susanna Clarke, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Piranesi-Susanna-Clarke/dp/163557563X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=piranesi&qid=1608303366&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=467f0498f921cf88ff2bb9b415969d62&language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Piranesi</a></strong></p><p>16 years after <em>Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell</em>, a new novel from Susanna Clarke.

The quarrel between the ancients and the moderns is already in full swing here, Bacon dunks on the Greeks constantly and upbraids people for blindly listening to Aristotle. He points to inventions like gunpowder and the compass and printing and paper and says that surely these indicate that there&#39;s a ton of undiscovered ideas out there, we should go looking for them. He talks about perceptual biases and scientific progress. Bacon&#39;s ambition feels limitless.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>But any man whose care and concern is not merely to be content with what has been discovered and make use of it, but to penetrate further; and not to defeat an opponent in argument but to conquer nature by action; and not to have nice, plausible opinions about things but sure, demonstrable knowledge; let such men (if they please), as true sons of the sciences, join with me, so that we may pass the antechambers of nature which innumerable others have trod, and eventually open up access to the inner rooms.</p></div></blockquote><p>Then you get to the second part and the Middle Ages hit you like a freight train, you suddenly realize this is no contemporary man at all and his conception of how the world works is completely alien. Ideas that to us seem bizarre and just intuitively nonsensical (about gravity, heat, light, biology, etc.) are only common sense to him. He repeats absurdities about light objects being pulled to the heavens while heavy objects are subject to the gravity of the earth, and so on. It&#39;s fascinating that both sides could exist in the same person. You won&#39;t learn anything new from Bacon, but it&#39;s a fascinating historical document.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Of twenty-five centuries in which human memory and learning is more or less in evidence, scarcely six can be picked out and isolated as fertile in sciences or favourable to their progress. There are deserts and wastes of time no less than of regions.</p></div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Signs should also be gathered from the growth and progress of philosophies and sciences.

We&#39;ve been going on about the replication crisis for a decade now, how could this possibly not affect people&#39;s trust in science?

It boils down to this: the judgment is inevitably going to be imperfect, so does the gain from doubting false science outweigh the loss from doubting true science? That depends on how good people are at doubting the right things.</p><p>There&#39;s some evidence <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2515245920919667" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that laypeople can distinguish which studies will replicate and which won&#39;t</a>, but this ability is limited and in the end relies on intuition rather than an understanding and analysis of the work. Statistical evidence is hard to evaluate: even <a href="http://www.psicothema.com/PDF/4266.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">academic psychologists</a> are pretty bad at the basics. The reasons why vaccines are probably safe and nutrition science is probably crap, the reasons why prospect theory is probably real and social priming is probably fake are complicated! If it was easy to make the right judgment, actual scientists wouldn&#39;t be screwing up all the time. Thus any disbelief laypeople end up with will probably be unjustified. And the worst thing about unjustified <em>true</em> disbeliefs is that they also carry unjustified <em>false</em> disbeliefs with them.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn4328525993" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref4328525993">3</sup></a></span></p><p>Another problem with unjustified disbelief is that it fails to alter incentives in a useful way.

So you think implicit bias is fake, what are you going to do with that information? Bring it up at your company&#39;s next diversity seminar?

The &quot;inside view&quot; is how we perceive our own personal situation, relying on our personal experiences and with the courage of our convictions. The &quot;outside view&quot; instead focuses on common elements, treating our situation as a single observation in a large statistical class.</p><p>From the inside view, skeptics <em>of all stripes</em> believe they are epistemically justified and posses superior knowledge. The people who think vaccines will poison their children believe it, the people who think the earth is flat believe it, and the people who doubt social science p=0.05 papers believe it. But the base rate of correctness among them is low, and the errors they make dangerous. How do you know if you&#39;re one of the actually competent skeptics with genuinely justified true disbelief? From the inside, you can&#39;t tell. And if you can&#39;t tell, you&#39;re better off just believing everything.</p><p>Some forms of disbelief are less dangerous than others. For example if epidemiologists tell you you don&#39;t need to wear a mask, but you choose to wear them anyway, there&#39;s very little downside if your skepticism is misguided. The reverse (not wearing masks when they tell you to) has a vastly larger downside. But again this relies on an ability to predict and weigh risks, etc.</p><p>The one thing we <em>can</em> appeal to is data from the outside: objectively graded forecasts, betting, market trading. And while these tools could quiet your own doubts, realistically the vast majority of people are not going to bother with these sorts of things.

Bishop argues against fixed notions of epistemic responsibility in <em><a href="https://philpapers.org/archive/BISIPO.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In Praise of Epistemic Irresponsibility: How Lazy and Ignorant Can You Be?</a></em>, instead favoring an environment where &quot;to a very rough first approximation, being epistemically responsible would involve nothing other than employing reliable belief-forming procedures.&quot; I&#39;m certainly in favor of that.</p><p>So if you&#39;re reading this and feel confident in your stats abilities, your generalist knowledge, your intelligence, the quality of your intuitions, and can back those up via an objective track record, then go ahead and disbelieve all you want. But spreading that disbelief to others seems irresponsible to me. Perhaps even telling lay audiences about the replication crisis is an error. Maybe Ritchie should buy up every copy of his book and burn them, for the common good.</p><h4 id="That-39-s-it"><a href="#That-39-s-it" class="headerlink" title="That&#39;s it?"></a>That&#39;s it?</h4><p>Yup. Plenty of experts are fake but people should trust them anyway. Thousands of &quot;studies&quot; are just nonsense but people should trust them anyway. On net, less disbelief would improve people&#39;s lives. And unless someone has an objective track record showing they know better (and you have the ability to verify and compare it), you should probably ignore the skeptics. Noble lies are usually challenging ethical dilemmas, but this one strikes me as a pretty easy case.</p><p>I can&#39;t believe I ended up as an establishment shill after all the shit I&#39;ve seen, but there you have it.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn4328525998" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref4328525998">8</sup></a></span> I&#39;m open to suggestions if you have a superior solution that would allow me to maintain an edgy contrarian persona.</p><div class="subscribediv" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:250px;margin-top:30px"><form class="validate" action="https://fantasticanachronism.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=2a6ff66ec7039625cb12680d5&amp;amp;id=f713c1306c" method="post" id="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" target="_blank"><div class="mc-field-group"><input class="required email" type="email" name="EMAIL" id="mce-EMAIL" placeholder="Type your email..."></div><div class="clear" id="mce-responses"><div class="respose" id="mce-error-response" style="display:none"></div><div class="respose" id="mce-success-response" style="display:none"></div></div><div style="position:absolute;left:-5000px" aria-hidden="true"><input type="text" name="b_2a6ff66ec7039625cb12680d5_f713c1306c" tabindex="-1"></div><div class="clear"><input type="submit" value="Subscribe" name="subscribe" id="mc-embedded-subscribe" clas="button"></div></form></div><div id="footnotes"><hr><div id="footnotelist"><ol style="list-style:none;padding-left:0;margin-left:40px"><li id="fn4328525991"><span style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;padding-right:10px;margin-left:-40px">1.</span><span><span class="footnote-contents">I am indebted to <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidAOliverJr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David A.

The evidence in favor of this view seems pretty good, a quick look at the technology, health, and wealth around us ought to convince anyone.</p><p>But sometimes one of these masters at the top of the mountain will say something so obviously incorrect, something even an amateur can see is false, that the only possible explanation is that they understand very little about their field. Sometimes vaguely smart generalists with some basic stats knowledge objectively outperform these experts. And if the masters at the top of the mountain aren&#39;t real, then that undermines the entire hierarchy of expertise.</p><h1 id="Real-Expertise"><a href="#Real-Expertise" class="headerlink" title="Real Expertise"></a>Real Expertise</h1><p>Some hierarchies are undeniably legitimate. Chess, for example, has the top players constantly battling each other, new players trying to break in (and sometimes succeeding), and it&#39;s all tracked by a transparent rating algorithm that is constantly updated. Even at the far right tails of these rankings, there are significant and undeniable skill gaps. There is simply no way Magnus Carlsen is secretly bad at chess.</p><p>Science would seem like another such hierarchy. The people at the top have passed through a long series of tests designed to evaluate their skills and knowledge, winnow out the undeserving, and provide specialized training: undergrad, PhD, tenure track position, with an armada of publications and citations along the way.</p><p>Anyone who has survived the torments of tertiary education will have had the experience of getting a broad look at a field in a 101 class, then drilling deeper into specific subfields in more advanced classes, and then into yet more specific sub-subfields in yet more advanced classes, until eventually you&#39;re stuck at home on a Saturday night reading an article in an obscure Belgian journal titled &quot;Iron Content in Antwerp Horseshoes, 1791-1794: Trade and Equestrian Culture Under the Habsburgs&quot;, and the list of references carries the threatening implication of an entire literature on the equestrian metallurgy of the Low Countries, with academics split into factions justifying or expostulating the irreconcilable implications of rival theories. And then you realize that there&#39;s an equally obscure literature about every single subfield-of-a-subfield-of-a-subfield. You realize that you will never be a polymath and that simply catching up with the state of the art in one tiny corner of knowledge is a daunting proposition. The thought of exiting this ridiculous sham we call life flashes in your mind, but you dismiss it and heroically persist in your quest to understand those horseshoes instead.</p><p>It is absurd to think that after such lengthy studies and deep specialization the experts could be secret frauds. As absurd as the idea that Magnus Carlsen secretly can&#39;t play Chess. Right?</p><h1 id="Fake-Expertise"><a href="#Fake-Expertise" class="headerlink" title="Fake Expertise?"></a>Fake Expertise?</h1><p>Imagine if tomorrow it was revealed that Magnus Carlsen actually doesn&#39;t know how to play chess. You can&#39;t then just turn to the #2 and go &quot;oh well, Carsen was fake but at least we have Fabiano Caruana, he&#39;s the real deal&quot;—if Carlsen is fake that also implicates every player who has played against him, every tournament organizer, and so on. The entire hierarchy comes into question. Even worse, imagine if it was revealed that Carlsen was a fake, but he still continued to be ranked #1 afterwards. So when I observe extreme credential-competence disparities in science or government bureaucracies, I begin to suspect the entire system.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn5071682222" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref5071682222">2</sup></a></span> Let&#39;s take a look at some examples.</p><h4 id="59"><a href="#59" class="headerlink" title="59"></a>59</h4><p>In 2015, Viechtbauer et al. published <em>A simple formula for the calculation of sample size in pilot studies</em>, in which they describe a simple method for calculating the required N for an x% chance of detecting a certain effect based on the proportion of participants who exhibit the effect. In the paper, they give an <em>example</em> of such a calculation, writing that if 5% of participants exhibit a problem, the study needs N=59 for a 95% probability of detecting the problem. The actual required N will, of course, vary depending on the prevalence of the effect being studied.</p><p>If you look at the <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0%2C5&cites=8563214002358604992&scipsc=1&q=59&btnG=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">papers citing Viechtbauer et al.</a>, you will find dozens of them simply using N=59, regardless of the problem they&#39;re studying, and explaining that they&#39;re using that sample size because of the Viechtbauer paper! The authors of these studies are professors at real universities, working in disciplines based almost entirely on statistical analyses. The papers passed through editors and peer reviewers. In <a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2020/09/11/whats-wrong-with-social-science-and-how-to-fix-it/">my piece on the replication crisis</a>, I wrote that I find it difficult to believe that social scientists don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing when they publish weak studies; one of the most common responses from scientists was &quot;no, they genuinely don&#39;t understand elementary statistics&quot;. It still seems absurd (just count the years from undergrad to PhD, how do you fail to pick this stuff up just by osmosis?) but it also appears to be true. How does this happen? Can you imagine a physicist who doesn&#39;t understand basic calculus? And if this is the level of competence among tenured professors, what is going on among the people below them in the hierarchy of expertise?</p><h4 id="Masks"><a href="#Masks" class="headerlink" title="Masks"></a>Masks</h4><p>Epidemiologists have beclowned themselves in all sorts of ways over the last year, but this is one of my favorites.

But if social priming is fake, well...? There are other factors at play, too, some of them rather nebulous: there&#39;s more to science than just running experiments and publishing stuff. Mertonian, distributed, informal community norms play a significant role in aligning prestige with real expertise, and these broader social mechanisms are the keystone that holds everything together. But such things are hard to measure and impossible to engineer. And can such an honor system persist indefinitely or will it eventually be subverted by bad actors?<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn5071682225" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref5071682225">5</sup></a></span></p><p>What does feedback look like in the social sciences? The norms don&#39;t seem to be operating very well. There&#39;s a small probability that your work will be replicated at some point, but really the main feedback mechanism is &quot;impact&quot; (in other words, citations). Since <a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2020/09/11/whats-wrong-with-social-science-and-how-to-fix-it/#or-Maybe-They-Don-39-t">citations in the social sciences are not related to truth</a>, this is useless at best.

There&#39;s your social science feedback loop!</p><p>The feedback loops of the academy are also predicated on the current credentialed insiders <em>actually being experts</em>. But if the N=59 crew are making such ridiculous errors in their <em>own</em> papers, they obviously don&#39;t have the ability to judge <em>other</em> people&#39;s papers either, and neither do the editors and reviewers who allow such things to be published—for the feedback loop to work properly you need both the cultural norms and genuinely competent individuals to apply them.</p><p>The candidate gene literature (of which <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/05/07/5-httlpr-a-pointed-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5-HTTLPR</a> was a subset) is an example of feedback and successful course correction: many years and thousands of papers were wasted on something that ended up being completely untrue, and while a few of these papers still trickle in, these days the approach has been essentially abandoned and replaced by genome-wide association studies. <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/04/17/learning-to-love-scientific-consensus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scott Alexander is rather sanguine</a> about the ability of scientific feedback mechanisms to eventually reach a true consensus, but I&#39;m more skeptical.

Electrical engineering is definitely real, and the government bases all sorts of policies on the knowledge of electrical engineers.

I read <em>Reviews Of Modern Physics</em> to keep abreast of fields like radio-astronomy, earth magnetism theory, and magneto-hydrodynamics. I even tried to write articles about them for general readers. But a growing number of the published papers in physics I could not follow, and I realized that fact with some bitterness.</p></div></blockquote><p>It is difficult (and probably wrong) for the magneto-hydrodynamics expert to barge into radio-astronomy and tell the specialists in that field that they&#39;re all wrong.

A lovely collection of 7 picaresque novellas that revolve around Maqroll, a cosmopolitan vagabond of the seas. Stylistically rich and sumptuous. It&#39;s set in a kind of parallel maritime world, the world of traders and seamen and port city whores. Very melancholy, with doomed business ventures at the edge of civilization, doomed loves, doomed lives, and so on. While the reader takes vicarious pleasure in the &quot;nomadic mania&quot; of Maqroll, the underlying feeling is one of fundamental dissatisfaction with what life has to offer—ultimately the book is about our attempts to overcome it.

A comprehensive, single-volume history of WWI from a German author. It goes far beyond military history: besides the battles and armaments it covers geopolitics and diplomacy, national politics, economics, public opinion, morale. All fronts and combatants are explored, and all this squeezed into just 900 pages (some things are inevitably left out - for example no mention is made of <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/03/17/book-review-hoover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hoover&#39;s famine relief efforts</a>). Its approach is rather abstract, so if you&#39;re looking for a visceral description of the trenches this isn&#39;t the book for you.

A concise work on the ethical dilemmas posed by genetic enhancement technology. It&#39;s written by a philosopher, but uses a lot of ideas from game theory and economics to work out the implications of genetic enhancement. Despite its short length, it goes into remarkable practical detail on things like how oxytocin affects behavior, the causes of global wealth inequality, and the potential of genetic editing to decrease the demand for plastic surgery. On the other hand, I did find it somewhat lacking (if not evasive) in its treatment of more general and abstract philosophical questions, such as: under what conditions is it acceptable to hurt people today in order to help future people?</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tristram-Shandy-Everymans-Library-Laurence/dp/0679405607/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=tristram+shandy+everyman&qid=1608401688&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=d542eb60c3611d52adc97718cec20a61&language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman</a></strong> by Laurence Sterne.

Now we have in our hands a new last 19th-century Russian novel—perhaps even the final one. And while Nabokov selected the obvious and trivial task of combining the Russian and American novels, our &quot;Dostoyevsky&quot; (an obvious pseudonym) has given himself the unparalleled and interminably heroic mission of combining the Russian novel with the Mexican soap opera. I am pleased to report that he has succeeded in producing a daring postmodern pastiche that truly evokes the 19th century.</p><p>The basic premise of <em>The Idiot</em> is lifted straight from Nietzsche&#39;s <em>Antichrist</em> 29-31:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>To make a <em>hero</em> of Jesus! And even more, what a misunderstanding is the word &#39;genius&#39;! Our whole concept, our cultural concept, of &#39;spirit&#39; has no meaning whatever in the world in which Jesus lives. Spoken with the precision of a physiologist, even an entirely different word would be yet more fitting here—the word idiot. [...] That strange and sick world to which the Gospels introduce us — a world like that of a Russian novel, in which refuse of society, neurosis and ‘childlike’ idiocy seem to make a rendezvous.</p></div></blockquote><p>The novel opens with Prince Lev Nikolayevich Myshkin, the titular idiot, returning by train to Russia after many years in the hands of a Swiss psychiatrist. He is a Christlike figure, as Nietzsche puts it &quot;a mixture of the sublime, the sickly, and the childlike&quot;, a naïf beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the corruptive influence of society. Being penniless, he seeks out a distant relative and quickly becomes entangled in St. Petersburg society.</p><p>If this were really a 19th century novel, it would follow a predictable course from this point: the &quot;idiot&quot; would turn out to be secretly wiser than everyone, the &quot;holy fool&quot; would speak truths inaccessible to normal people, his purity would highlight the corruption of the world around him, his naiveté would ultimately be form of nobility, and so on.</p><p>Instead, Myshkin finds himself starring in a preposterous <em>telenovela</em> populated by a vast cast of absurdly melodramatic characters. He quickly receives an unexpected inheritance that makes him wealthy, and is then embroiled in a web of love and intrigue. As in any good soap opera, everything is raised to extremes in this book: there are no love triangles because three vertices would not be nearly enough; instead there are love polyhedrons, possibly in four or seven dimensions.</p><p>Myshkin&#39;s first love interest is the intimidating, dark, and self-destructive Nastasya Fillipovna. An orphan exploited by her guardian, she is the talk of the town and chased by multiple suitors, including the violent Rogozhin and the greedy Ganya. Myshkin thinks she&#39;s insane but pities her so intensely that they have an endless and tempestuous on-again off-again relationship, which includes Nastasya skipping out on multiple weddings. In the construction of this character I believe I detect the subtle influence of the <em>yandere</em> archetype from Japanese <em>manga</em>.</p><p>The second woman in Myshkin&#39;s life is the young and wealthy Aglaya Ivanovna: proud, snobbish, and innocent, she cannot resist mocking Myshkin, but at the same time is deeply attracted to him. Whereas Nastasya loves Myshkin but thinks she&#39;s not good enough for him, Aglaya loves him but thinks she&#39;s too good for him.</p><p>The main cast is rounded off by a bunch of colorful characters, including the senile general Epanchin, various aristocrats, a boxer, a religious maniac, and Ippolit the nihilist who spends 600 pages in a permanent state of almost-dying (consumption, <em>of course</em>) and even gets a suicide fakeout scene that would make the producers of <em>The Young and the Restless</em> blush.</p><p>As Myshkin&#39;s relationships develop, he is always kind, non-judgmental, honest and open with his views. But this is not the story of good man taken advantage of, but rather the story of a man who is simply incapable of living in the real world. Norm Macdonald, after seeing the musical <em>Cats</em>, exclaimed: <a href="https://youtu.be/X8A040Mq0kQ?t=453" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&quot;it&#39;s about actual cats!&quot;</a> The reader of <em>The Idiot</em> will inevitably experience the same shock of recognition, muttering &quot;Mein Gott, it&#39;s about an actual idiot!&quot; His behavior ends up hurting not only himself, but also the people around him, the people he loves. In the climax, Nastasya and Aglaya battle for Myshkin&#39;s heart, but it&#39;s a disaster as he makes all the wrong choices.</p><p>That&#39;s not to say that it&#39;s all serious; the drama is occasionally broken up by absurdist humor straight out of Monty Python:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Everyone realized that the resolution of all their bewilderment had begun.</p><p>‘Did you receive my hedgehog?’ she asked firmly and almost angrily.</p></div></blockquote><p>Postmodern games permeate the entire novel: for example, what initially appears to be an omniscient narrator is revealed in the second half to simply be another character (a deeply unreliable one at that); one who sees himself as an objective reporter of the facts, but is really a gossip and rumourmonger. Toward the end he breaks the fourth wall and starts going on bizarre digressions that recall <em>Tristram Shandy</em>: at one point he excuses himself to the reader for digressing too far, then digresses <em>even further</em> to complain about the quality of the Russian civil service. The shifts in point of view become disorienting and call attention to the artificial nature of the novel. Critically, he never really warms up to Myshkin:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>In presenting all these facts and refusing to explain them, we do not in the least mean to justify our hero in the eyes of our readers. More than that, we are quite prepared to share the indignation he aroused even in his friends.</p></div></blockquote><p><strong>Double Thoughts and Evolutionary Psychology</strong></p><p>The entire novel revolves around the idea of the &quot;double thought&quot;, an action with two motives: one pure and conscious, the other corrupt and hidden. Keller comes to Myshkin in order to confess his misdeeds, but also to use the opportunity to borrow money. Awareness of the base motive inevitably leads to guilt and in some cases self-destructive behavior. This is how Myshkin responds:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>You have confused your motives and ideas, as I need scarcely say too often happens to myself. I can assure you, Keller, I reproach myself bitterly for it sometimes. When you were talking just now I seemed to be listening to something about myself. At times I have imagined that all men were the same,’ he continued earnestly, for he appeared to be much interested in the conversation, ‘and that consoled me in a certain degree, for a DOUBLE motive is a thing most difficult to fight against. I have tried, and I know. God knows whence they arise, these ideas that you speak of as base. I fear these double motives more than ever just now, but I am not your judge, and in my opinion it is going too far to give the name of baseness to it—what do you think? You were going to employ your tears as a ruse in order to borrow money, but you also say—in fact, you have sworn to the fact— that independently of this your confession was made with an honourable motive.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn4307752491" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref4307752491">1</sup></a></span></p></div></blockquote><p>The &quot;double thought&quot; is an extension of the concept of self-deception invented by evolutionary psychologist Robert Trivers, and, simply put, this book could not have existed without his work. Trivers has been writing about self-deception since the 70s in academic journals and books (including his 2011 book <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Folly-Fools-Logic-Deceit-Self-Deception/dp/0465085970/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=folly+of+fools&qid=1606422816&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=13b91589eb6effe67313f9cabf8e6650&language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Folly of Fools</a></em>). The basic idea is that people subconsciously deceive themselves about the true motives of their actions, because it&#39;s easier to convince others when you don&#39;t have to lie.</p><p>Dostoyevsky&#39;s innovation lies in examining what happens when someone becomes aware of their subconscious motives and inevitably feels guilty. There is empirical evidence that <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article/20/1/205/417824" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inhibition of guilt makes deception more effective</a>, but this novel inverts that problem and asks the question: what happens when that inhibition fails and guilt takes over? The author&#39;s penetrating psychological analysis finds a perfect home in the soap opera setting, as the opposition of extreme emotions engendered by the double thought complements the melodrama. Dostoyevsky even goes a step further, and argues that self-consciousness of the double thought <em>is a double thought in itself</em>: &quot;I couldn&#39;t help thinking ... that everyone is like that, so that I even began patting myself on the back&quot;. There is no escape from the signaling games we play. The complexity of unconscious motives is a recurring theme:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Don&#39;t let us forget that the causes of human actions are usually immeasurably more complex and varied than our subsequent explanations of them.</p></div></blockquote><p>In a move of pure genius, Dostoyevsky plays with this idea on three levels in parallel: first, the internal contrast between pure and corrupt motives within each person; second, the external contrast between the pure Idiot Myskin and the corrupt society around him; third, on the philosophical level of <em>Dionysus versus The Crucified</em>. And in the end he comes down squarely in the camp of Dionysus and against Myshkin. Just as the Idiot is not ultimately good, so consciousness and the innocent motivations are not good either: the novel decides the issue strongly in favor of the corrupt motive, in favor of instinct over ratiocination, in favor of Dionysus over Apollo, in favor of the earthly over Christianity. We must live our lives in this world and deal with it as it is.</p><p><strong>Double Anachronism</strong></p><p>In the brilliant essay <em>The Argentine Writer and Tradition</em>, Borges writes that &quot;what is truly native can and often does dispense with local color&quot;. Unfortunately Mssr. Dostoyevsky overloads his novel with local color, which in the end only highlights its artificiality. The lengths to which he has gone to make this novel appear as if it were a real product of the 19th century are admirable, but by overextending himself, he undermines the convincing (though fantastic) anachronism; like a double thought, the underlying deception leaks out and ruins everything. In a transparent and desperate reach for verisimilitude, he has included a series of references to real crimes from the 1860s. One cannot help but imagine the author bent over some dusty newspaper archive in the bowels of the National Library on Nevsky Prospekt, mining for details of grisly murders and executions.</p><p>Unfortunately <em>The Idiot</em> is anachronistic in more ways than one: as the juvenile influence of <em>Der Antichrist</em> hints, Dostoyevsky is a fervent anti-Christian who epitomizes the worst excesses of early-2000s New Atheism. Trivers wrote the foreword to Dawkins&#39;s <em>The Selfish Gene</em>, so it is no surprise that Dostoyevsky would be part of that intellectual tradition. But the heavy-handed anti-religious moralizing lacks nuance and gets old fast. His judgment of Myshkin, the representative of <em>ideal</em> Christianity, is heavy, but on top of that he also rants about the Catholic church, the representative of <em>practical</em> Christianity. He leaves no wiggle room in his condemnations.</p><p>And the lesson he wants to impart is clear: that Christianity is not only impractical and hypocritical, but actively ruins the lives of the people it touches. But these views hardly pass the smell test. While Dostoyevsky has mastered evolutionary psychology, he seems to have ignored cultural evolution. As Joe Henrich lays out in his latest book, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/WEIRDest-People-World-Psychologically-Particularly/dp/0374173222/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=The+WEIRDest+People+in+the+World:+How+the+West+Became+Psychologically+Peculiar+and+Particularly+Prosperous&qid=1606740298&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=beee70c54a242e7e50672075444d68c4&language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The WEIRDest People in the World: How the West Became Psychologically Peculiar and Particularly Prosperous</a></em>, the real-world influence of Christianity as a pro-social institution is a matter that deserves a far more nuanced examination. So if I could give Mssr. Dostoyevsky one piece of advice it would be this: less Dawkins, more Henrich please. After all, a devotee of Nietzsche should have a more subtle view of these things.</p><div class="subscribediv" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:250px;margin-top:30px"><form class="validate" action="https://fantasticanachronism.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=2a6ff66ec7039625cb12680d5&amp;amp;id=f713c1306c" method="post" id="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" target="_blank"><div class="mc-field-group"><input class="required email" type="email" name="EMAIL" id="mce-EMAIL" placeholder="Type your email..."></div><div class="clear" id="mce-responses"><div class="respose" id="mce-error-response" style="display:none"></div><div class="respose" id="mce-success-response" style="display:none"></div></div><div style="position:absolute;left:-5000px" aria-hidden="true"><input type="text" name="b_2a6ff66ec7039625cb12680d5_f713c1306c" tabindex="-1"></div><div class="clear"><input type="submit" value="Subscribe" name="subscribe" id="mc-embedded-subscribe" clas="button"></div></form></div><div id="footnotes"><hr><div id="footnotelist"><ol style="list-style:none;padding-left:0;margin-left:40px"><li id="fn4307752491"><span style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;padding-right:10px;margin-left:-40px">1.</span><span><span class="footnote-contents">See also <em>Daybreak</em> 523: &quot;With everything that a person allows to become visible one can ask: What is it supposed to hide?&quot;</span><a href="#fnref4307752491" rev="footnote"> ↩</a></span></li></ol></div></div></div></div><br><hr class="postDivider"><br><div class="post"><h1 class="post-title"><a href="/2020/11/28/metascience-and-philosophy/">Metascience and Philosophy</a></h1><div class="post-meta">2020-11-28</div><a class="disqus-comment-count" data-page-id="/2020/11/28/metascience-and-philosophy/" href="/2020/11/28/metascience-and-philosophy/#commento"></a><div class="post-content"><p>It has been said that philosophy of science is as useful to scientists as ornithology is to birds.

Today the field is a backwater, lost in endless debates about scientific realism which evoke the malaise of medieval angelology.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn12516001551" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref12516001551">1</sup></a></span> Despite being part of philosophy, however, the field made actual progress, abandoning simplistic early models for more sophisticated approaches with greater explanatory power. Ultimately, philosophers reached one of two endpoints: some went full relativist,<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn12516001552" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref12516001552">2</sup></a></span> while others (like Quine and Laudan) bit the bullet of naturalism and left the matter to metascientists and psychologists.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn12516001553" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref12516001553">3</sup></a></span> &quot;It is an empirical question, which means promote which ends&quot;.</p><p><strong>Metascience</strong></p><p>Did the metascientists actually pick up the torch? Sort of. There is some overlap, but (with the exception of the great Paul Meehl) they tend to focus on different problems. The current crop of metascientists is drawn, like sharks to blood, to easily quantifiable questions about the recent past (with all those p-values sitting around how could you resist analyzing them?). They focus on different fields, and therefore different problems. They seem hesitant to make normative claims. Less tractable questions about forms of progress, norms, theory selection, etc. have fallen by the wayside. Overall I think they underrate the problems posed by philosophers.</p><h3 id="Rational-Reconstruction"><a href="#Rational-Reconstruction" class="headerlink" title="Rational Reconstruction"></a>Rational Reconstruction</h3><p>In <em><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/495757?seq=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The History of Science and Its Rational Reconstructions</a></em> Lakatos proposed that theories of scientific methodology function as historiographical theories and can be criticized or compared to each other by using the theories to create &quot;rational historical reconstructions&quot; of scientific progress. The idea is simple: if a theory fails to rationally explain the past successes of science, it&#39;s probably not a good theory, and we should not adopt its normative tenets. As Lakatos puts it, &quot;if the rationality of science is inductive, actual science is not rational; if it is rational, it is not inductive.&quot; He applied this &quot;Pyrrhonian <em>machine de guerre</em>&quot; not only to inductivism and confirmationism, but also to Popper.</p><p>The main issue with falsification boils down to the problem of auxiliary hypotheses. On the one hand you have underdetermination (the Duhem-Quine thesis): testing hypotheses in isolation is not possible, so when a falsifying result comes out it&#39;s not clear where the modus tollens should be directed. On the other hand there is the possibility of introducing <em>new</em> auxiliary hypotheses to &quot;protect&quot; an existing theory from falsification. These are not merely abstract games for philosophers, but very real problems that scientists have to deal with. Let&#39;s take a look at a couple of historical examples from the perspective of naïve falsificationism.</p><p>First, Newton&#39;s laws. They were already falsified at the time of publication: they failed to correctly predict the motion of the moon. In the words of Newton, &quot;the apse of the Moon is about twice as swift&quot; as his predictions. Despite this falsification, the <em>Principia</em> attracted followers who worked to improve the theory. The moon was no small problem and took two decades to solve with the introduction of new auxiliary hypotheses.</p><p>A later episode involving Newton&#39;s laws illustrates how treacherous these auxiliary hypotheses can be. In 1846 Le Verrier (<a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2020/01/17/having-had-no-predecessor-to-imitate/">I have written about him before</a>) solved an anomaly in the orbit of Uranus by hypothesizing the existence of a new planet. That planet was Neptune and its discovery was a wonderful confirmation of Newton&#39;s laws. A decade later Le Verrier tried to solve an anomaly in the orbit of Mercury using the same method. The hypothesized new planet was never found and Newton&#39;s laws remained at odds with the data for decades (yet nobody abandoned them). The solution was only found in 1915 with Einstein&#39;s general relativity: Newton <em>should</em> have been abandoned this time!</p><p>Second, Prout&#39;s hypothesis: in 1815 William Prout proposed that the atomic weights of all elements were multiples of the atomic weight of hydrogen. A decade later, chemists measured the atomic weight of chlorine at 35.45x that of hydrogen and Prout&#39;s hypothesis was clearly falsified. Except, a century after that, isotopes were discovered: variants of chemical elements with different neutron numbers. Turns out that natural chlorine is composed of 76% <sup>35</sup>Cl and 24% <sup>37</sup>Cl, hence the atomic weight of 35.45. Whoops! So here we have a case where falsification depends on an auxiliary hypothesis (no isotopes) which the experimenters have no way of knowing.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn12516001554" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref12516001554">4</sup></a></span></p><p>Popper tried to rescue falsificationism through a series of unsatisfying ad-hoc fixes: exhorting scientists not to be naughty when introducing auxiliary hypotheses, and saying falsification only applies to &quot;serious anomalies&quot;. When asked what a serious anomaly is, he replied: &quot;if an object were to move around the Sun in a square&quot;!<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn12516001555" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref12516001555">5</sup></a></span></p><p><strong>Problem, officer?</strong></p><p>There are a few problems with rational reconstruction, and while I don&#39;t think any of them are fatal, they do mean we have to tread carefully.</p><p><strong>External factors</strong>: no internal history of science can explain the popularity of Lysenkoism in the USSR—sometimes we have to appeal to external factors. But the line between internal and external history is unclear, and can even depend on your methodology of choice.</p><p><strong>Meta-criterion choice</strong>: what criteria do you use to evaluate the quality of a rational reconstruction?

As Peter Medawar noted in <em><a href="http://blog.thegrandlocus.com/static/misc/is_the_scientific_paper_fraudulent.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Is the scientific paper a fraud?</a></em>, the &quot;official record&quot; of scientific progress contains few traces of the messy process that actually generated said progress.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn12516001557" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref12516001557">7</sup></a></span> He further argues that there is a desire to conform to a particular ideal of induction which creates a biased picture of how scientific discovery works.</p><h3 id="Falsification-in-Metascience"><a href="#Falsification-in-Metascience" class="headerlink" title="Falsification in Metascience"></a>Falsification in Metascience</h3><p>Now, let&#39;s shift our gaze to metascience. There&#39;s a fascinating subgenre of psychology in which researchers create elaborate scientific simulations and observe subjects as they try to make &quot;scientific discoveries&quot;. The results can help us understand how scientific reasoning actually happens, how people search for hypotheses, design experiments, create new concepts, and so on. My favorite of these is <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15516709cog1703_3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dunbar (1993)</a>, which involved a bunch of undergraduate students trying to recreate a Nobel-winning discovery in biochemistry.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn12516001558" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref12516001558">8</sup></a></span></p><p>Reading these papers one gets the sense that there is a falsificationist background radiation permeating everything. When the subjects don&#39;t behave like falsificationists, it&#39;s simply treated as an error or a bias. Klahr &amp; Dunbar scold their subjects: &quot;our subjects frequently maintained their current hypotheses in the face of negative information&quot;. And <em>within the tight confines</em> of these experiments it&#39;s usually true that it is an error. But this reflects the design of the experiment rather than any inherent property of scientific reasoning or progress, and extrapolating these results to real-world science in general would be a mistake.</p><p>Sociology offers a cautionary tale about what happens when you take this kind of reasoning to an extreme: the strong programme people started with an idealistic (and wrong) philosophy of science, they then observed that real-world science does not actually operate like that, and concluded that it&#39;s all based on social forces and power relations, descending into an abyss of epistemological relativism. To reasonable people like you and me this looks like an excellent <em>reductio ad absurdum</em>, but sociologists are a special breed and <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Modus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one man’s modus ponens is another man’s modus tollens</a>. The same applies to over-extensions of falsificationism. Lakatos:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>...those trendy &#39;sociologists of knowledge&#39; who try to explain the further (possibly unsuccessful) development of a theory &#39;falsified&#39; by a &#39;crucial experiment&#39; as the manifestation of the irrational, wicked, reactionary resistance by established authority to enlightened revolutionary innovation.</p></div></blockquote><p>One could also argue that the current focus on replication is too narrow. The issue is obscured by the fact that in the current state of things the original studies tend to be very weak, the &quot;theories&quot; do not have track records of success, and the replications tend to be very strong, so the decision is fairly easy. But one can imagine a future scenario in which failed replications should be treated with far more skepticism.</p><p>There are also some empirical questions in this area that are ripe for the picking: at which point do scientists shift their beliefs to the replication over the original? What factors do they use? What do they view a falsification as actually refuting (ie where do they direct the modus tollens)? Longitudinal surveys, especially in the current climate of the social sciences, would be incredibly interesting.</p><h3 id="Unit-of-Progress"><a href="#Unit-of-Progress" class="headerlink" title="Unit of Progress"></a>Unit of Progress</h3><p>One of the things philosophers of science are in agreement about is that individual scientists cannot be expected to behave rationally. Recall the example of Prout and the atomic weight of chlorine above: Prout simply didn&#39;t accept the falsifying results, and having obtained a value of 35.83 by experiment, rounded it to 36. To work around this problem, philosophers instead treated wider social or conceptual structures as the relevant unit of progress: &quot;thinking style groups&quot; (Fleck), &quot;paradigms&quot; (Kuhn), &quot;research programmes&quot; (Lakatos), &quot;research traditions&quot; (Laudan), etc. When a theory is tested, the implications of the result depend on the broader structure that theory is embedded in. Lakatos:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>We have to study not the mind of the individual scientist but the mind of the Scientific Community. [...] Kuhn certainly showed that psychology of science can reveal important-and indeed sad-truths. But psychology of science is not autonomous; for the-rationally reconstructed-growth of science takes place essentially in the world of ideas, in Plato&#39;s and Popper&#39;s &#39;third world&#39;.</p></div></blockquote><p>Psychologists are temperamentally attracted to the individual, and this is reflected in their metascientific research methods which tend to focus on individual scientists&#39; thinking, or isolated papers. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.2466/pr0.1993.72.3.707" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meehl</a>, for example, simply views this as an opportunity to optimize individuals&#39; cognitive performance:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>The thinking of scientists, especially during the controversy or theoretical crises preceding Kuhnian revolutions, is often not rigorous, deep, incisive, or even fair-minded; and it is not &quot;objective&quot; in the sense of interjudge reliability. Studies of resistance to scientific discovery, poor agreement in peer review, negligible impact of most published papers, retrospective interpretations of error and conflict all suggest suboptimal cognitive performance.</p></div></blockquote><p>Given the importance of broader structures however, things that seem irrational from the individual perspective might make sense collectively. Institutional design is criminally under-explored, and the differences in attitudes both over time and over the cross section of scientists are underrated objects of study.</p><p>You might retort that this is a job for the sociologists, but look at what they have produced: on the one hand they gave us <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2597530657" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robert Merton</a>, and on the other hand the strong programme. They don&#39;t strike me as particularly reliable.</p><h3 id="Fields-amp-Theories"><a href="#Fields-amp-Theories" class="headerlink" title="Fields &amp; Theories"></a>Fields &amp; Theories</h3><p>Almost all the scientists doing philosophy of science were physicists or chemists, and the philosophers stuck to those disciplines in their analyses. Today&#39;s metascientists on the other hand mostly come from psychology and medicine. Not coincidentally, they tend to focus on psychology and medicine. These fields tend to have different kinds of challenges compared to the harder sciences: the relative lack of theory, for example, means that today&#39;s metascientists tend to ignore some of the most central parts of philosophy of science, such as questions about Lakatos&#39;s &quot;positive heuristic&quot; and how to judge auxiliary hypotheses, questions about whether the logical or empirical content of theories is preserved during progress, questions about how principles of theory evaluation change over time, and so on.</p><p>That&#39;s not to say no work at all has been done in this area, for example <a href="http://meehl.umn.edu/sites/meehl.dl.umn.edu/files/147appraisingamending.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paul Meehl</a><span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn12516001559" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref12516001559">9</sup></a></span> tried to construct a quantitative index of a theory&#39;s track record that could then be used to determine how to respond to a falsifying result. There&#39;s also some similar work from a Bayesian POV. But much more could be done in this direction, and much of it depends on going beyond medicine and the social sciences. &quot;But Alvaro, I barely understand p-values, I could never do the math needed to understand physics!&quot; If the philosophers could do it then so can the psychologists. But perhaps these problems require broader interdisciplinary involvement: not only specialists from other fields, but also involvement from neuroscience, computational science, etc.</p><h3 id="What-is-progress"><a href="#What-is-progress" class="headerlink" title="What is progress?"></a>What is progress?</h3><p>One of the biggest questions the philosophers tried to answer was how progress is made, and how to even define it. Notions of progress as strictly cumulative (ie the new theory has to explain everything explained by the old one) inevitably lead to relativism, because theories are sometimes widely accepted at an &quot;early&quot; stage when they have limitations relative to established ones. But what is the actual process of consensus formation? What principles do scientists actually use? What principles <em>should</em> they use? Mertonian theories about agreement about standards/aims are clearly false, but we don&#39;t have anything better to replace them. This is another question that depends on looking beyond psychology, toward more theory-oriented fields.</p><h3 id="Looking-Ahead"><a href="#Looking-Ahead" class="headerlink" title="Looking Ahead"></a>Looking Ahead</h3><p>Metascience can continue the work and actually solve important questions posed by philosophers:</p><ul><li>Is there a difference between mature and immature fields? Should there be?</li><li>What guiding assumptions are used for theory choice? Do they change over time, and if yes how are they accepted/rejected? What is the best set of rules? <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.2466/pr0.1993.72.3.707" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meehl&#39;s suggestions</a> are a good starting point: &quot;We can construct other indexes of qualitative diversity, formal simplicity, novel fact predictivity, deductive rigor, and so on. Multiple indexes of theoretical merit could then be plotted over time, intercorrelated, and related to the long-term fate of theories.&quot;</li><li>Can we tell, in real time, which fields are progressing and which are degenerating? If not, is this an opening for irrationalism? What factors should we use to decide whether to stick with a theory on shaky ground?

While praise for the work is universal, the main question commentators try to answer is this: how did the worst man in the world manage to write the best biography?</p><h1 id="The-Man"><a href="#The-Man" class="headerlink" title="The Man"></a>The Man</h1><p>Who was James Boswell? He was a perpetual drunk, a degenerate gambler, a sex addict, whoremonger, exhibitionist, and rapist. He gave his wife an STD he caught from a prostitute.</p><p>Selfish, servile and self-indulgent, lazy and lecherous, vain, proud, obsessed with his aristocratic status, yet with no sense of propriety whatsoever, he frequently fantasized about the feudal affection of serfs for their lords. He loved to watch executions and was a proud supporter of slavery.</p><p>“Where ordinary bad taste leaves off,” John Wain comments, “Boswell began.” The Thrales were long-time friends and patrons of Johnson; a <em>single day</em> after Henry Thrale died, Boswell wrote a poem fantasizing about the elderly Johnson and the just-widowed Hester: &quot;Convuls&#39;d in love&#39;s tumultuous throws, / We feel the aphrodisian spasm&quot;. The rest of his verse is of a similar quality; naturally he considered himself a great poet.</p><p>Boswell combined his terrible behavior with a complete lack of shame, faithfully reporting every transgression, every moronic ejaculation, every faux pas. The first time he visited London he went to see a play and, as he happily tells us himself, he &quot;entertained the audience prodigiously by imitating the lowing of a cow.&quot;</p><p>By all accounts, including his own, he was an idiot. On a tour of Europe, his tutor said to him: &quot;of young men who have studied I have never found one who had so few ideas as you.&quot;</p><p>As a lawyer he was a perpetual failure, especially when he couldn&#39;t get Johnson to write his arguments for him. As a politician he didn&#39;t even get the chance to be a failure despite decades of trying.</p><p>His correspondence with Johnson mostly consists of Boswell whining pathetically and Johnson telling him to get his shit together.</p><p>He commissioned a portrait from his friend Joshua Reynolds and stiffed him on the payment. His descendants hid the portrait in the attic because they were ashamed of being related to him.</p><p>Desperate for fame, he kept trying to attach himself to important people, mostly through sycophancy. In Geneva he pestered Rousseau,<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn2939929991" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref2939929991">1</sup></a></span> leading to this conversation:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Rousseau: You are irksome to me. It’s my nature. I cannot help it.<br>Boswell: Do not stand on ceremony with me.<br>Rousseau: Go away.</p></div></blockquote><p>Later, Boswell was given the task of escorting Rousseau&#39;s mistress Thérèse Le Vasseur to England—they had an affair on the way.</p><p>When Adam Smith and Edward Gibbon were elected to The Literary Club, Boswell considered leaving because he thought the club had now &quot;lost its select merit&quot;!</p><p>On the positive side, his humor and whimsy made for good conversation; he put people at ease; he gave his children all the love his own father had denied him; and, somehow, he wrote one of the great works of English literature.</p><h1 id="The-Masterpiece"><a href="#The-Masterpiece" class="headerlink" title="The Masterpiece"></a>The Masterpiece</h1><p><em>The Life of Samuel Johnson, LL.D.</em> was an instant sensation. While the works of Johnson were quickly forgotten,<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn2939929992" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref2939929992">2</sup></a></span> his biography has never been out of print in the 229 years since its initial publication. It went through 41 editions just in the 19th century.</p><p>Burke told King George III that he had never read anything more entertaining. Coleridge said &quot;it is impossible not to be amused with such a book.&quot; George Bernard Shaw compared Boswell&#39;s dramatization of Johnson to Plato&#39;s dramatization of Socrates, and placed old Bozzy in the middle of an &quot;apostolic succession of dramatists&quot; from the Greek tragedians through Shakespeare and ending, of course, with Shaw himself.</p><p>It is a strange work, an experimental collage of different modes: part traditional biography, part collection of letters, and part direct reports of Johnson&#39;s life as observed by Boswell.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn2939929993" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref2939929993">3</sup></a></span> His inspiration came not from literature, but from the minute naturalistic detail of Flemish paintings. It is difficult to convey its greatness in compressed form: Boswell is not a great writer at the sentence level, and all the famous quotes are (hilarious) Johnsonian <em>bon mots</em>. The book succeeds through a cumulative effect.</p><p>Johnson was 54 years old when he first met Boswell, and most of his major accomplishments (the poetry, the dictionary, <em>The Rambler</em>) were behind him; his wife had already died; he was already the recipient of a £300 pension from the King; his edition of Shakespeare was almost complete. All in all they spent no more than 400 days together. Boswell had limited material to work with, but what he doesn&#39;t capture in fact, he captures in feeling: an entire life is contained in this book: love and friendship, taverns and work, the glory of success and recognition, the depressive bouts of failure and penury, the inevitable tortures of aging and death.</p><p>Out of a person, Boswell created a literary personality. His powers of characterization are positively Shakespearean, and his Johnson resembles none other but the bard&#39;s greatest creation: Sir John Falstaff. Big, brash, and deeply flawed, but also lovable. He would &quot;laugh like a rhinoceros&quot;:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Johnson could not stop his merriment, but continued it all the way till he got without the Temple-gate. He then burst into such a fit of laughter that he appeared to be almost in a convulsion; and in order to support himself, laid hold of one of the posts at the side of the foot pavement, and sent forth peals so loud, that in the silence of the night his voice seemed to resound from Temple-bar to Fleet ditch.</p></div></blockquote><p>And around Johnson he painted an entire dramatic cast, bringing 18th century London to life: Garrick the great actor, Reynolds the painter, Beauclerk with his banter, Goldsmith with his insecurities. Monboddo and Burke, Henry and Hester Thrale, the blind Mrs Williams and the Jamaican freedman Francis Barber.</p><p>Borges (who was also a big fan) finds his parallels not in Shakespeare and Falstaff, but in Cervantes and Don Quixote. He (rather implausibly) suggests that every Quixote needs his Sancho, and &quot;Boswell appears as a despicable character&quot; deliberately to create a contrast.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn2939929994" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref2939929994">4</sup></a></span></p><p>And in the 1830s, two brilliant and influential reviews were written by two polar opposites: arch-progressive Thomas Babington Macaulay and radical reactionary Thomas Carlyle. The first thing you&#39;ll notice is their sheer magnitude: <a href="http://oll-resources.s3.amazonaws.com/titles/362/1227.01_Bk.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Macaulay&#39;s</a> is 55 pages long, while <a href="https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511697234.003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carlyle&#39;s review in Fraser&#39;s Magazine</a> reaches 74 pages!<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn2939929995" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref2939929995">5</sup></a></span> And while they both agree that it&#39;s a great book and that Boswell was a scoundrel, they have very different theories about what happened.</p><h2 id="Macaulay"><a href="#Macaulay" class="headerlink" title="Macaulay"></a>Macaulay</h2><p>Never in history, Macaulay says, has there been &quot;so strange a phænomenon as this book&quot;. On the one hand he has effusive praise:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Homer is not more decidedly the first of heroic poets, Shakspeare is not more decidedly the first of dramatists, Demosthenes is not more decidedly the first of orators, than Boswell is the first of biographers. He has no second. He has distanced all his competitors so decidedly that it is not worth while to place them.</p></div></blockquote><p>On the other hand, he spends several paragraphs laying into Boswell with gusto:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>He was, if we are to give any credit to his own account or to the united testimony of all who knew him, a man of the meanest and feeblest intellect. [...] He was the laughing-stock of the whole of that brilliant society which has owed to him the greater part of its fame. He was always laying himself at the feet of some eminent man, and begging to be spit upon and trampled upon. [...] Servile and impertinent, shallow and pedantic, a bigot and a sot, bloated with family pride, and eternally blustering about the dignity of a born gentleman, yet stooping to be a talebearer, an eavesdropper, a common butt in the taverns of London.</p></div></blockquote><p>Macaulay&#39;s theory is that while Homer and Shakespeare and all the other greats owe their eminence to their virtues, Boswell is unique in that he owes <em>his</em> success to his vices.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>He was a slave, proud of his servitude, a Paul Pry, convinced that his own curiosity and garrulity were virtues, an unsafe companion who never scrupled to repay the most liberal hospitality by the basest violation of confidence, a man without delicacy, without shame, without sense enough to know when he was hurting the feelings of others or when he was exposing himself to derision; and because he was all this, he has, in an important department of literature, immeasurably surpassed such writers as Tacitus, Clarendon, Alfieri, and his own idol Johnson.</p></div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Of the talents which ordinarily raise men to eminence as writers, Boswell had absolutely none. There is not in all his books a single remark of his own on literature, politics, religion, or society, which is not either commonplace or absurd. [...] Logic, eloquence, wit, taste, all those things which are generally considered as making a book valuable, were utterly wanting to him. He had, indeed, a quick observation and a retentive memory. These qualities, if he had been a man of sense and virtue, would scarcely of themselves have sufficed to make him conspicuous; but, because he was a dunce, a parasite, and a coxcomb, they have made him immortal.</p></div></blockquote><p>The work succeeds partly because of its subject: if Johnson had not been so extraordinary, then airing all his dirty laundry would have just made him look bad.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>No man, surely, ever published such stories respecting persons whom he professed to love and revere. He would infallibly have made his hero as contemptible as he has made himself, had not his hero really possessed some moral and intellectual qualities of a very high order. The best proof that Johnson was really an extraordinary man is that his character, instead of being degraded, has, on the whole, been decidedly raised by a work in which all his vices and weaknesses are exposed.</p></div></blockquote><p>And finally, Boswell provided Johnson with a curious form of literary fame:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>The reputation of [Johnson&#39;s] writings, which he probably expected to be immortal, is every day fading; while those peculiarities of manner and that careless table-talk the memory of which, he probably thought, would die with him, are likely to be remembered as long as the English language is spoken in any quarter of the globe.</p></div></blockquote><h2 id="Carlyle"><a href="#Carlyle" class="headerlink" title="Carlyle"></a>Carlyle</h2><p>Carlyle rates Johnson&#39;s biography as the greatest work of the 18th century. In a sublime passage that brings tears to my eyes, he credits the <em>Life</em> with the power of halting the inexorable passage of time:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Rough Samuel and sleek wheedling James <em>were</em>, and <em>are not</em>. [...] The Bottles they drank out of are all broken, the Chairs they sat on all rotted and burnt; the very Knives and Forks they ate with have rusted to the heart, and become brown oxide of iron, and mingled with the indiscriminate clay. All, all has vanished; in every deed and truth, like that baseless fabric of Prospero&#39;s air-vision. Of the Mitre Tavern nothing but the bare walls remain there: of London, of England, of the World, nothing but the bare walls remain; and these also decaying (were they of adamant), only slower. The mysterious River of Existence rushes on: a new Billow thereof has arrived, and lashes wildly as ever round the old embankments; but the former Billow with <em>its</em> loud, mad eddyings, where is it? Where! Now this Book of Boswell&#39;s, this is precisely a revocation of the edict of Destiny; so that Time shall not utterly, not so soon by several centuries, have dominion over us. A little row of Naphtha-lamps, with its line of Naphtha-light, burns clear and holy through the dead Night of the Past: they who are gone are still here; though hidden they are revealed, though dead they yet speak. There it shines, that little miraculously lamplit Pathway; shedding its feebler and feebler twilight into the boundless dark Oblivion, for all that our Johnson touched has become illuminated for us: on which miraculous little Pathway we can still travel, and see wonders.</p></div></blockquote><p>Carlyle disagrees completely with Macaulay: it is not because of his vices that Boswell could write this book, but rather because he managed to overcome them. He sees in Boswell a hopeful symbol for humanity as a whole, a victory in the war between the base and the divine in our souls.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>In fact, the so copious terrestrial dross that welters chaotically, as the outer sphere of this man&#39;s character, does but render for us more remarkable, more touching, the celestial spark of goodness, of light, and Reverence for Wisdom, which dwelt in the interior, and could struggle through such encumbrances, and in some degree illuminate and beautify them.</p></div></blockquote><p>Boswell&#39;s shortcomings were visible: he was &quot;vain, heedless, a babbler&quot;. But if that was the whole story, would he really have chosen Johnson? He could have picked more illustrious targets, richer ones, perhaps some powerful statesman or an aristocrat with a distinguished lineage. &quot;Doubtless the man was laughed at, and often heard himself laughed at for his Johnsonism&quot;. Boswell must have been attracted to Johnson by nobler motives. And to do that he would have to &quot;hurl mountains of impediment aside&quot; in order to overcome his nature.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>The plate-licker and wine-bibber dives into Bolt Court, to sip muddy coffee with a cynical old man, and a sour-tempered blind old woman (feeling the cups, whether they are full, with her finger); and patiently endures contradictions without end; too happy so he may but be allowed to listen and live.</p></div></blockquote><p>The <em>Life</em> is not great because of Boswell&#39;s foolishness, but because of his love and his admiration, an admiration that Macaulay considered a disease. Boswell wrote that in Johnson&#39;s company he &quot;felt elevated as if brought into another state of being&quot;.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>His sneaking sycophancies, his greediness and forwardness, whatever was bestial and earthy in him, are so many blemishes in his Book, which still disturb us in its clearness; wholly hindrances, not helps. Towards Johnson, however, his feeling was not Sycophancy, which is the lowest, but Reverence, which is the highest of human feelings.</p></div></blockquote><p>On Johnson&#39;s personality, Carlyle writes: &quot;seldom, for any man, has the contrast between the ethereal heavenward side of things, and the dark sordid earthward, been more glaring&quot;. And this is what Johnson wrote about Falstaff in his Shakespeare commentary:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Falstaff is a character loaded with faults, and with those faults which naturally produce contempt. [...] the man thus corrupt, thus despicable, makes himself necessary to the prince that despises him, by the most pleasing of all qualities, perpetual gaiety, by an unfailing power of exciting laughter, which is the more freely indulged, as his wit is not of the splendid or ambitious kind, but consists in easy escapes and sallies of levity, which make sport but raise no envy.</p></div></blockquote><p>Johnson obviously enjoyed the comparison to Falstaff, but would it be crazy to also see Boswell in there? The Johnson presented to us in the <em>Life</em> is a man who had to overcome poverty, disease, depression, and a constant fear of death, but never let those things poison his character. Perhaps Boswell crafted the character he wished he could become: Johnson was his Beatrice—a dream, an aspiration, an ideal outside his grasp that nonetheless thrust him toward greatness. Through a process of self-overcoming Boswell wrote a great book <em>on</em> self-overcoming.</p><h1 id="Mediocrities-Everywhere-I-Absolve-You"><a href="#Mediocrities-Everywhere-I-Absolve-You" class="headerlink" title="Mediocrities Everywhere...I Absolve You"></a>Mediocrities Everywhere...I Absolve You</h1><p>The story of Boswell is basically the plot of <em>Amadeus</em>, with the role of Salieri being played by Macaulay, by Carlyle, by me, and—perhaps even by yourself, dear reader. The line between admiration, envy, and resentment is thin, and crossing it is easier when the subject is a scoundrel. But if Bozzy could set aside resentment for genuine reverence, perhaps there is hope for us all. And yet...it would be an error to see in Boswell the Platonic Form of Mankind.</p><p>Shaffer and Forman&#39;s film portrays Mozart as vulgar, arrogant, a womanizer, bad with money—but, like Bozzy, still somehow quite likable. In one of the best scenes of the film, we see Mozart transform the screeching of his mother-in-law into the <em>Queen of the Night Aria</em>; thus Boswell transformed his embarrassments into literary gold. He may be vulgar, but his productions are not. He may be vulgar, but he is not <em>ordinary</em>.</p><p>Perhaps it is in vain that we seek correlations among virtues and talents: perhaps genius is ineffable. Perhaps it&#39;s Ramanujans all the way down. You can&#39;t even say that genius goes with independence: there&#39;s nothing Boswell wanted more than social approval. I won&#39;t tire you with clichés about the Margulises and the Musks.</p><p>Would Johnson have guessed that he would be the mediocrity, and Bozzy the genius? Would he have felt envy and resentment? What would he say, had he been given the chance to read in Carlyle that Johnson&#39;s own writings &quot;are becoming obsolete for this generation; and for some future generation may be valuable chiefly as Prolegomena and expository Scholia to this <em>Johnsoniad</em> of Boswell&quot;?</p><hr><p>If you want to read <em>The Life of Johnson</em>, I recommend a second-hand copy of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Life-Samuel-Johnson-Everymans-Library/dp/0679417176/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=everyman+boswell&qid=1603063608&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=05e6a4ef771943ffaad957d1971983bc&language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Everyman&#39;s Library edition</a>: cheap, reasonably sized, and the paper &amp; binding are great.</p><div class="subscribediv" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:250px;margin-top:30px"><form class="validate" action="https://fantasticanachronism.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=2a6ff66ec7039625cb12680d5&amp;amp;id=f713c1306c" method="post" id="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" target="_blank"><div class="mc-field-group"><input class="required email" type="email" name="EMAIL" id="mce-EMAIL" placeholder="Type your email..."></div><div class="clear" id="mce-responses"><div class="respose" id="mce-error-response" style="display:none"></div><div class="respose" id="mce-success-response" style="display:none"></div></div><div style="position:absolute;left:-5000px" aria-hidden="true"><input type="text" name="b_2a6ff66ec7039625cb12680d5_f713c1306c" tabindex="-1"></div><div class="clear"><input type="submit" value="Subscribe" name="subscribe" id="mc-embedded-subscribe" clas="button"></div></form></div><div id="footnotes"><hr><div id="footnotelist"><ol style="list-style:none;padding-left:0;margin-left:40px"><li id="fn2939929991"><span style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;padding-right:10px;margin-left:-40px">1.</span><span><span class="footnote-contents">In the very first letter Boswell wrote to Rousseau, he described himself as &quot;a man of singular merit&quot;.</span><a href="#fnref2939929991" rev="footnote"> ↩</a></span></li><li id="fn2939929992"><span style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;padding-right:10px;margin-left:-40px">2.</span><span><span class="footnote-contents">They were &quot;rediscovered&quot; in the early 1900s.</span><a href="#fnref2939929992" rev="footnote"> ↩</a></span></li><li id="fn2939929993"><span style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;padding-right:10px;margin-left:-40px">3.</span><span><span class="footnote-contents">While some are quick to dismiss the non-direct parts, I think they're necessary, especially the letters which illuminate a different side of Johnson's character.</span><a href="#fnref2939929993" rev="footnote"> ↩</a></span></li><li id="fn2939929994"><span style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;padding-right:10px;margin-left:-40px">4.</span><span><span class="footnote-contents">Lecture #10 in <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Professor-Borges-Course-English-Literature/dp/0811218759/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&amp;keywords=professor+borges:+a+course+of+english+literature&amp;qid=1603324256&amp;sr=8-1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=fantasticanch-20&amp;linkId=6e802bbe28a3d8090ec7900d406e080e&amp;language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Professor Borges: A Course on English Literature</a></em>.</span><a href="#fnref2939929994" rev="footnote"> ↩</a></span></li><li id="fn2939929995"><span style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;padding-right:10px;margin-left:-40px">5.</span><span><span class="footnote-contents">What happened to the novella-length book review?

While he did not actually invent the scientific method, his discussion of empiricism, experiments, and induction was clearly a step in that direction. The first part deals with science and empiricism and induction from an abstract perspective and it feels almost contemporary, like it was written by a time traveling 19th century scientist or something like that. The quarrel between the ancients and the moderns is already in full swing here, Bacon dunks on the Greeks constantly and upbraids people for blindly listening to Aristotle. Question received dogma and popular opinions, he says. He points to inventions like gunpowder and the compass and printing and paper and says that surely these indicate that there&#39;s a ton of undiscovered ideas out there, we should go looking for them. He talks about cognitive biases and scientific progress:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>we are laying the foundations not of a sect or of a dogma, but of human progress and empowerment.</p></div></blockquote><p>Then you get to the second part and the middle ages hit you like a freight train, you suddenly realize this is no contemporary man at all and his conception of how the world works is completely alien. Ideas that to us seem bizarre and just intuitively nonsensical (about gravity, heat, light, biology, etc.) are only common sense to him. He repeats absurdities about worms and flies arising spontaneously out of putrefaction, that light objects are pulled to the heavens while heavy objects are pulled to the earth, and so on. Not just surface-level opinions, but fundamental things that you wouldn&#39;t even think someone else could possibly perceive differently.</p><p>You won&#39;t learn anything new from Bacon, but it&#39;s a fascinating historical document.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Marvels-Travels-Oxford-Worlds-Classics/dp/0199600600/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=The+Book+of+Marvels+and+Travels&qid=1601510803&s=books&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=e6b9ece6757c8c81566a4ecf69e4a6a8&language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Book of Marvels and Travels</a></strong> by John Mandeville. This medieval bestseller (published around 1360) combines elements of travelogue, ethnography, and fantasy. It&#39;s unclear how much of it people believed, but there was huge demand for information about far-off lands and marvelous stories. Mostly compiled from other works, it was incredibly popular for centuries. In the age of exploration (Columbus took it with him on his trip) people were shocked when some of the fantastical stories (eg about cannibals) actually turned out to be true. The tricks the author uses to generate verisimilitude are fascinating: he adds small personal touches about people he met, sometimes says that he doesn&#39;t know anything about a particular region because he hasn&#39;t been there, etc.</p></li></ul><div class="subscribediv" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:250px;margin-top:30px"><form class="validate"
