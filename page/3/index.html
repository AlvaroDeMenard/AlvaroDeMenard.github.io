<strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2RPA5gC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The World of Yesterday</a></strong></p><p>From the late 19th century to World War II, through the eyes of Stefan Zweig. From the stable order, prosperity, and peace of the Austro-Hungarian Empire to fratricidal wars, Weimar Germany, and Nazism. Mechanization, electrification, the breakdown of ossified social and political structures. Beautifully written and just incredibly sad and wistful. Zweig finished the manuscript in February 1942, posted it to his publisher, and killed himself the next day.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>For I have indeed been torn from all my roots, even from the earth that nourished them, more entirely than most in our times. I was born in 1881 in the great and mighty empire of the Habsburg Monarchy, but you would look for it in vain on the map today; it has vanished without trace. I grew up in Vienna, an international metropolis for two thousand years, and had to steal away from it like a thief in the night before it was demoted to the status of a provincial German town. My literary work, in the language in which I wrote it, has been burnt to ashes in the country where my books made millions of readers their friends. So I belong nowhere now, I am a stranger or at the most a guest everywhere.</p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="/images/bb19_kreutzersonata-cb6417702a5a6cff1b22912768709e58.jpg" class="floatright nofancybox"><p>Leo Tolstoy, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kreutzer-Sonata-Stories-Penguin-Classics/dp/0140449604/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=The+Kreutzer+Sonata&qid=1580839425&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=72080e5eb32ecbecedd3d240323a718d&language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Kreutzer Sonata</a></strong></p><p>Chesterton wrote that Tolstoy pitied humanity not only for its pains, but also for its pleasures: &quot;He weeps at the thought of hatred; but in <em>The Kreutzer Sonata</em> he weeps almost as much at the thought of love.&quot; Delightfully dark and cynical to an extreme degree—like a presentiment of Cioran in the form of a Russian moralist.

Everything is somehow...suspended and quasi-magical, detached from the rules of everyday life.

Instead, there are <em>descriptions</em> of conversations, which never touch on the subject but focus on the atmosphere and effects.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Herminien possessed the gift of penetrating the secrets of literature and art with subtle and perfect taste, revealing, however, their mechanism rather than all the power of the grace they contained.</p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="/images/bb19_urneburiall-5fa532d2196ba439f2384b2b0f619f83.jpg" class="floatleft nofancybox"><p>Sir Thomas Browne, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Religio-Medici-Urne-Buriall-Review-Classics/dp/1590174887/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=Urne-Buriall&qid=1580839515&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=38aa754211cd6dd75370347cbb2ad026&language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hydriotaphia, Urne-Buriall, or, a Discourse of the Sepulchrall Urnes lately found in Norfolk</a></strong></p><p>This classic essay from 1658 counts among its fans Borges, De Quincey, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Poe.

Browne begins by discussing an archaeological find in a dry, almost anthropological mode and then moves on to death, religion, burial rites, fame and infamy—all the while the style escalates to a wonderful Baroque crescendo in the final chapter.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>There is no antidote against the Opium of time, which temporally considereth all things; Our Fathers finde their graves in our short memories, and sadly tell us how we may be buried in our Survivors.

To be read by bare Inscriptions like many in Gruter, to hope for Eternity by Ænigmaticall Epithetes, or first letters of our names, to be studied by Antiquaries, who we were, and have new Names given us like many of the Mummies, are cold consolations unto the Students of perpetuity, even by everlasting Languages.</p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="/images/bb19_manintheholocene-d491b23004a9a2207408a180c81effdb.jpg" class="floatright nofancybox"><p>Max Frisch, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Man-Holocene-Max-Frisch/dp/1564784665/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=man+in+the+holocene&qid=1580839535&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=f4958e5c1f069de99b7ed0f1623d3916&language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Man in the Holocene</a></strong></p><p>An experimental novella about knowledge, memory, and aging.

There&#39;s a Wolfeian dying world feel to it—they go by ship because the land route has been devastated by the invasion. Rutilius decries Christian ascetics hiding out from the world, though never losing hope that Rome will bounce back.

This is a World War II memoir in the form of a bucolic comedy. A couple of charming and eccentric British officers (one was Moss, the other was famous travel writer Patrick Leigh Fermor) based in Egypt come up with the idea of abducting General Kreipe from Crete. They go to Crete, do a bit of spying, have a great time with the peasant guerrillas in the mountains drinking raki and wine, enjoying great food, and reading Baudelaire. Eventually they get to the general, which involves all sorts of daring deeds and close calls as the Nazis try to capture them and they try to escape back to Egypt. It&#39;s a fantastic (if somewhat juvenile) adventure all-round.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>We are now hiding in a delightful spot which is about a quarter of a mile from Patsos. We sleep in a stone-walled hut which has been built against the base of a steep cliff, so with trees on three sides and the cliff behind us we could not have found a more sheltered position. Close at hand there is a waterfall, and all day long we hear the sound of water as it tumbles away, down and down into the valley. This sound seems to attract every bird in the neighbourhood, and from dawn till dusk we can hear nightingales singing in the trees around us. Nightingales seem mostly to sing in the day-time in Crete—but that’s Crete all over. “No sense of timing,” as Paddy has said.</p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="/images/bb19_bartleby-dfdfcd9614edac284e254b5b54c2b421.jpg" class="floatright nofancybox"><p>Herman Melville, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bartleby-Scrivener-Wall-Street-Herman-Melville-ebook/dp/B00DQHN0I8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=Bartleby,+the+Scrivener&qid=1580839705&s=books&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=81ddcc2403d64e5778fe73d56827a89d&language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bartleby, the Scrivener</a></strong></p><p>The polar opposite of Moby-Dick in almost every way.

Covers a lot of ground in very little space: Lovecraft&#39;s life, his themes, his style, critical reactions. Avoids the cheap psychologizing that many Lovecraft critics fall into. And reveals a lot about Houellebecq himself, too.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Lovecraft, in fact, hasn’t got the attitude of a novelist. Hardly any novelist of any description imagines that it is within his capacities to give an exhaustive depiction of life. Their mission is rather to “shed new light” on it; but given the facts themselves there is absolutely no choice. Sex, money, religion, technology, ideology, redistribution of wealth…a good novelist can’t ignore anything. And all this must take place within a coherent vision, grosso modo, of the world. Obviously the task is scarcely humanly possible, and the result almost always disappointing. A nasty profession.</p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="/images/bb19_bloodmeridian-a250590517812a9dfe5e4bb823c93e8c.jpg" class="floatright nofancybox"><p>Cormac McCarthy, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blood-Meridian-Evening-Redness-West/dp/0679728759/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=Blood+Meridian&qid=1580839764&s=books&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=3dd109c4f42abe2a84256906e92eb103&language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blood Meridian, or The Evening Redness in the West</a></strong></p><p>Desolation, deserts, blood, mud, savagery, endless death, and senseless brutality.

In 1795 Friedrich August Wolf published <em>Prolegomena ad Homerum</em> which established the basis for the Homeric Question debates over the next century (though, as the 11th edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica reminds us, his argument was so overwhelming it would not be challenged for 30 years<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn11418650723" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref11418650723">3</sup></a></span>).

Any line that did not suit their tastes was declared an interpolation, and repetitions were taken as proof of copying by later poets. They all agreed that the <em>Iliad</em> was the work of multiple poets, and that philologists could &quot;scientifically prove&quot;<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn11418650728" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref11418650728">8</sup></a></span> it. Yet no two Analysts could ever agree on <em>which</em> parts were Homer&#39;s and which were later additions.</p><p>Bethe thought it was the work of two poets. Theiler argued for 5 or 6. Hermann proposed that the <em>Iliad</em> consisted of a bunch of crap surrounding the pristine core of the original Homer, while Lachmann argued that it actually consisted of 18 different folk stories strung together, like the Finnish <em>Kalevala</em>. Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff (I swear I&#39;m not making up these names) claimed to detect three different &quot;layers&quot; in the <em>Odyssey</em>, one of which (the &quot;old <em>Odyssey</em>&quot;—books 5-14 and 17-19) had in turn been compiled from three different, even earlier poems, two of which had originally been part of <em>other</em>, longer poems. Wilamowitz went as far as to call the <em>Iliad</em> &quot;a miserable piece of patchwork&quot;. Bryant argued the city of Troy never existed at all.</p><p>Arrayed against the Analysts were the Unitarians led by Gregor Wilhelm Nitzsch, who still believed the poems were mostly the work of a single author. Unable to counter Wolf&#39;s historical arguments, they relied on internal evidence, appealing to the poem&#39;s stylistic unity and intricate structure. How is it possible, they would ask, for a collection of different folk tales to have a coherent plot and characters, and where do all these elaborate structural correspondences come from?</p><img src="/images/homer_structure-5cee29e069a16d33c06c77eee13313d4.jpg"><p>The Unitarians had an anti-enlightenment aesthetic, fundamentally doubting the possibility of logical analysis of poetry. De Quincey got involved and declared all the external arguments irrelevant: &quot;all arguments worth a straw in this matter must be derived from the internal structure of the &#39;Iliad.&#39;&quot; And in some cases the Unitarian cause was wrapped up with religious conservatism: if one accepted the analyst arguments in the case of Homer, one could hardly deny them in the case of the Old Testament.</p><p>Perhaps the most famous Unitarian was Heinrich Schliemann who was not a philologist at all but rather a globetrotting con artist and businessman. After amassing a vast fortune, Schliemann dedicated his life to finding the ruins of Troy. His trust in Homer was complete (even compared to other Unitarians, most of whom believed Homer contained no useful topographical details), and it was rewarded when he discovered Troy exactly where Homer said it would be. What he actually found was a later city on the same site as Troy and unfortunately he had no training as an archaeologist which meant that he completely destroyed the ruins, but Homer had led him to the right place.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn11418650729" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref11418650729">9</sup></a></span></p><p>The battle raged on, and by the early 20th century the Analysts had the upper hand while Unitarianism was a heretical minority view. Thus in 1920 Georg Brandes could write that &quot;save for a few uncritical people, of course, no one to-day believes that a single poet named Homer wrote either the Iliad or the Odyssey&quot;. Yet in the same year, John A. Scott, a respected philologist, published his passionately polemical <em>The Unity of Homer</em>, ridiculing the German Analysts and proclaiming the greatness of Homer.</p><p>And there were problems that neither side could solve, despite more than a century of intense scholarship, such as the peculiar mixture of dialects in Homer. The <em>Iliad</em> and the <em>Odyssey</em> are composed in a language that was never spoken by anyone, a blend of dialects from all across Greece. This was obviously a problem for the Unitarians, but the Analysts did not have any explanations either: the dialects were not cleanly separated (as you might expect from a combination of different poems), but jumbled together, sometimes even <em>within a single word</em>: a prefix from one dialect and a postfix from another. It was difficult to argue that 6th century Athenian poets wrote like this.</p><h2 id="Abduction"><a href="#Abduction" class="headerlink" title="Abduction"></a>Abduction</h2><p>In the early 19th century, scientists started noticing that the orbit of Uranus did not match the predictions of Newton&#39;s laws. In 1846, the French astronomer Urbain Le Verrier proposed a solution: he hypothesized the existence of an undiscovered planet and, based on the magnitude of the perturbation, worked backwards and deduced its mass and orbit. Le Verrier sent his results by post to Johann Gottfried Galle at the Berlin Observatory. They were received on September 23. At midnight, Neptune was discovered—exactly in the position predicted. It was an absolute triumph: a bold mathematical prediction and confirmation of Newton&#39;s laws, instantly validated by the discovery of an entirely new planet.</p><p>A decade later, Le Verrier reported that the precession of the perihelion of Mercury did not match the predictions of Newton&#39;s laws. But he knew what to do, and once again estimated the mass and orbit of a hypothetical new planet which would explain the anomaly. We may deduce his confidence from the fact that he quickly named this planet—&quot;Vulcan&quot;. (Astute readers may recall that no planet with that name can be found in our solar system.)</p><p>Astronomers failed to detect Vulcan, though they kept trying with every new eclipse up to 1908.

And hypotheses tend to be trickier to acquire. The problem was finally solved in 1915 when Einstein introduced general relativity, which perfectly predicted Mercury&#39;s perihelion advance without any ad hoc hypotheses or fudge factors.</p><p>The pragmatist philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce coined the term &quot;abduction&quot; (as opposed to &quot;deduction&quot; and &quot;induction&quot;) to describe inference from effect to cause (in other words, from data to novel and successful hypotheses). As Le Verrier&#39;s example shows, it is a fickle art.

Nobody knows how or why this magical meat works, nobody has even proposed a set of rules that might approximate the abduction process, and the continued upward techonomic trajectory of our civilization fundamentally depends on its continued operation.</p><h2 id="The-Solution"><a href="#The-Solution" class="headerlink" title="The Solution"></a>The Solution</h2><p>By the early 1900s the Homeric Question war had been raging for over a century, with no end in sight. Homerists had all the data, but what they really needed was the right hypothesis. The man to provide it was the American Milman Parry, who proposed a third alternative: neither pastiche nor unitarian composition, but the culmination of a formulaic oral tradition. The first breakthrough came with his 1928 dissertation, <em>L&#39;Épithète Traditionnelle dans Homère: Essai sur un problème de style Homérique</em><span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn114186507216" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref114186507216">16</sup></a></span> in which Parry demonstrated that Homer composed orally, using fixed phrases and combinations called formulae. Five years later he travelled to Bosnia with Albert Lord, seeking out oral poets in places still unspoiled by literacy.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn114186507217" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref114186507217">17</sup></a></span> By studying their technique and comparing it to Homer, they confirmed the oral-formulaic hypothesis.</p><p>To understand this system we have to start with a short refresher on Homer&#39;s meter, the dactylic hexameter: five dactyls (a long syllable followed by two short ones, —UU) plus a spondee (— —) or trochee (—U) at the end:</p><p><center>— U U, — U U, — U U, — U U, — U U, — —</center></p><p>Imagine a rapper freestyling a song about a war. Now imagine him doing that for 15,693 lines (or about 24 hours). Now imagine not just freestyling, but freestyling <em>to a specific meter</em>. Extemporaneous composition was only possible because Homer had a vast repertoire of formulae which fit onto the dactylic hexameter like lego blocks. For example, Achilles is πόδας ὠκὺς Ἀχιλλεύς (swift-footed Achilles) when Homer needs to fill seven syllables, and δῖος Ἀχιλλεύς (godlike Achilles) when he needs to fill five (and both formulae appear only at the end of the line).</p><p>Parry found two essential qualities in this system: scope, and economy. Homer had &quot;a noun-epithet formula to meet every regularly recurring need. And what is equally striking, there is usually only one such formula&quot;. The formulae are not limited to epithets, but also cover type-scenes such as battles and speeches—explaining the repetitions which the Analysts blamed on copying by later poets. Similarly, the various small inconsistencies are simply the result of the method of composition: it&#39;s hard to keep every detail in mind when you&#39;re busy composing and singing.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn114186507218" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref114186507218">18</sup></a></span></p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>We shall find then, I think, that this failure to see the difference between written and oral verse was the greatest single obstacle to our understanding of Homer, we shall cease to be puzzled by much, we shall no longer look for much that Homer would never have thought of saying, and above all, we shall find that many, if not most of the questions we were asking, were not the right ones to ask.</p></div></blockquote><p>Thus by abducting the right hypothesis, Parry could explain everything that had been mysterious about Homer&#39;s style. The mixture of dialects was a natural result of an old and widespread tradition. Archaisms and neologisms could exist side by side because the formulae evolved at different points in time.</p><p>The formulaic system was vast and Parry emphasized that it was impossible for any one man to put it together: this is where the element of tradition comes in. It developed by a slow processes of accumulation, a long lineage of bards across the centuries, each one adding a few phrases of his own to the great edifice of epic poetry.</p><p>We can use the development of the Greek language to trace the age of various formulae. Once a phrase was put in a particular metric place, it tended to stay there <em>regardless of whether it continued to actually fit the meter</em>. Early Greek featured a letter called the <em>digamma</em> (which represented the /w/ sound) and formulae were composed using that letter. As the language evolved the <em>digamma</em> disappeared and the formulae no longer fit the meter—but they stayed in the same place. This was a mortal blow to the Analysts: it would have been an extraordinary coincidence for a 6th century poet to write a metrically faulty line as if it had been caused by a letter that he had never heard of.</p><p>Just like the oral tradition preserved the ghost of a lost letter, it also preserved forgotten words: for &quot;the great number of noun-epithet formulas in which the meaning of the epithet has been lost to us&quot;, the meaning had been lost to Homer also. And with the language it also preserved details from the world of Bronze Age Greece: wealthy Mycenae, war chariots, boar tusk helmets, etc. If the poems had continued being oral <em>after</em> Homer&#39;s time, the language would have continued evolving. Thus we can establish probable dates for the composition based on the neologisms.</p><p>Comically, the Germans simply pretended that Parry did not exist for a while. Harder wrote in 1942 that &quot;no one any longer doubts that Homer could write, and wrote his poetry down&quot;.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn114186507219" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref114186507219">19</sup></a></span> In the end, even though almost none of Homer&#39;s language was his own direct creation, you could say the Unitarians won: in his 2011 review of the Homeric Question, Martin West writes &quot;we all agree these days that the Iliad and Odyssey are unified poems [...] And we all accept the implication, that this design is a design conceived by a single author, however much it may owe to earlier poems&quot;. If there were any doubt left, computer-based stylometric analysis finds &quot;an astonishing homogeneity&quot; in the <em>Iliad</em> (though not so much in the <em>Odyssey</em>).<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn114186507220" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref114186507220">20</sup></a></span></p><p>The final piece of the puzzle fell into place in the 1950s when Michael Ventris deciphered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_B" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Linear B</a>. Up to that point it was believed that the the Myceneans (the stars of Homer&#39;s story) were simply not Greek. Ventris himself was absolutely certain they were Etruscan, writing that the theory that Linear B &quot;could be Greek is based...on a deliberate disregard for historical plausibility&quot;.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn114186507221" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref114186507221">21</sup></a></span> This raised all sorts of questions about the transmission of details that predate the 13th century collapse. But since they <em>were</em> Greek, an oral epic tradition reaching back to that time is entirely plausible. This also provides us with an elegant explanation for the Bellerophon story: epic poetry preserved the idea of writing even though the technology had been lost for over 500 years:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>&quot;Would you be killed, o Proitos? Then murder Bellerophontes who tried to lie with me in love, though I was unwilling.&quot;<br>So she spoke, and anger took hold of the king at her story.<br>He shrank from killing him, since his heart was awed by such action,<br>but sent him away to Lykia, and handed him murderous symbols,<br>which he inscribed in a folding tablet, enough to destroy life,<br>and told him to show it to his wife&#39;s father, that he might perish.</p></div></blockquote><p>And what about the transmission issues? The most popular view today (though there is no consensus) is the amanuensis theory: Homer was illiterate, but someone wrote down his song and passed it along. The example of Hesiod, whose long written works survived, shows that it&#39;s not outside the realm of possibility. Some of the difficulties Wolf pointed out are still there, and Haslam (a <em>supporter</em> of the amanuensis theory) says that writing down the poems would have been &quot;an enterprise so remarkable that it is hard to credit&quot;. But the alternatives seem yet more doubtful.</p><p>In the 18-19th centuries many scholars, in whose minds literacy and intelligence were inextricably linked, worried that illiteracy would degrade Homer&#39;s achievement.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn114186507222" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref114186507222">22</sup></a></span> But it only makes it more impressive. A poem like the <em>Iliad</em> can only exist <em>because</em> of Homer&#39;s illiteracy, not <em>despite</em> of it. Once literacy penetrated the Greek world, oral poetry disappeared. By the 6th century the bards had been replaced by <em>rhapsodoi</em>, no longer creative poets but merely parrots (like Plato&#39;s Ion).</p><p>Some argue that Homer was a transitional figure, that he could write but still knew the ways of oral composition. Others think that&#39;s impossible. The idea of a literate Homer opens up all sorts of intriguing and unlikely possibilities: writing—the technology that killed oral poetry—also <em>immortalized</em> what used to be transient and perishable. Remarkably, what it preserved was a poem about the use of art and fame (<em>klea andron</em>, the famous deeds of men) to overcome mortality. Perhaps the <em>Iliad</em> is one big allegory for the written word. Would Homer have been conscious of the decline of oral poetry? Ultimately, the only reason we can read him today is that he happened to live in that tiny sliver of time when oral poetry was still alive <em>and</em> the technology existed to preserve it for the future. Who knows what great poets sang into the void across those letterless aeons.</p><p>Not only did Homer have predecessors to imitate, he was drawing on an ancient tradition that survived the Greek Dark Ages—an eternal flame passed from singer to singer across the centuries, sustaining a vague, mythic memory of a fallen civilization. A tradition that was quickly extinguished when, on a bright summer morning, a curious trader asked some Phoenicians about their scribbles.</p><h3 id="Further-Reading"><a href="#Further-Reading" class="headerlink" title="Further Reading"></a>Further Reading</h3><ul><li>G.
