Here&#39;s one of my favorite charts, showing growth in how much cutting edge could be produced from 1kg of flint during the stone age:<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn5567868311" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref5567868311">1</sup></a></span></p><img src="/images/twopaths_cuttingedge-ff5ba0a72195e4827b2ea79be4211eba.png"><p>Note the logarithmic y-axis—the growth is not exponential but hyperbolic! Of course what appears to be a singularity is really the lower half of an s-curve, but that was enough to trigger a paradigm shift to a new, higher curve: bronze. The stone-age singularity was the end of stone. Can what is playing you make it to level-2?</p><p>Where are we today? It&#39;s hard to say without the benefit of hindsight, but it sure feels like the upper half of an s-curve. Things are decelerating: economic growth is falling, fertility is cratering, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180222152845/http://www.xenosystems.net/iq-shredders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IQ shredders</a> are quickly using up the finite biological substrate necessary to sustain our upward path. The world of 2020 is more or less the same as the world of 1920. We are richer, have better technology, but the fundamentals are quite similar: we&#39;re on the same curve. All we&#39;re doing is getting more blades from our flint.</p><p>The world of 2120 is going to be radically different. In exactly what way I cannot say, any more than a peasant in 1500 could predict the specifics of the industrial revolution. But it almost certainly involves unprecedented levels of growth as the constraints of the old paradigm are dissolved under the new one. One corollary to this view is that our long-term concerns (global warming, dysgenics, aging societies) are only relevant to the extent that they affect the arrival of the next paradigm.</p><p>There are two paths to the future: silicon, and DNA. Whichever comes first will determine how things play out. The response to the coronavirus pandemic has shown that current structures are doomed to fail against a serious adversary: if we want to have a chance against silicon, we need better people. That is why I think any AI &quot;control&quot; strategy not predicated on transhumanism is unserious.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn5567868312" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref5567868312">2</sup></a></span></p><p>Our neolithic forefathers could not have divined the metallurgical destiny of their descendants, but today, perhaps for the first time in universal history, we can catch a glimpse of the next paradigm before it arrives.

Good forecasts are either based on past data, or generalization from theories constructed from past data. Because of their novelty, paradigm shifts are difficult to predict. We&#39;re in uncharted waters here. But there are two sources of information we can use: biological intelligence (brains, human or otherwise), and progress in the limited forms of artificial intelligence we have created thus far.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn5567868314" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref5567868314">4</sup></a></span></p><h3 id="ML-progress"><a href="#ML-progress" class="headerlink" title="ML progress"></a>ML progress</h3><p>GPT-3 forced me to start taking AI concerns seriously. Two features make GPT-3 a scary sign of what&#39;s to come: scaling, and meta-learning. Scaling refers to gains in performance from increasing the number of parameters in a model. Here&#39;s a chart from the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GPT-3 paper</a>:</p><img src="/images/twopaths_scaling-bdb7b8ce6368f8d1a7f2ab7b900e5206.png"><p>Meta-learning refers to the ability of a model to learn how to solve novel problems. GPT-3 was trained purely on next-word prediction, but developed a wide array of <em>surprising</em> problem-solving abilities, including translation, programming, arithmetic, literary style transfer, and SAT analogies. Here&#39;s another GPT-3 chart:</p><img src="/images/twopaths_fewshot-2ebfb336aebb45afe77a06f8da45330d.png"><p>Put these two together and extrapolate, and it seems like a sufficiently large model trained on a diversity of tasks will eventually be capable of superhuman general reasoning abilities. As gwern <a href="https://www.gwern.net/newsletter/2020/05" target="_blank" rel="noopener">puts it</a>:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>More concerningly, GPT-3’s scaling curves, unpredicted meta-learning, and success on various anti-AI challenges suggests that in terms of futurology, AI researchers’ forecasts are an emperor sans garments: they have no coherent model of how AI progress happens or why GPT-3 was possible or what specific achievements should cause alarm, where intelligence comes from, and do not learn from any falsified predictions.</p></div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>GPT-3 is scary because it’s a magnificently obsolete architecture from early 2018 (used mostly for software engineering convenience as the infrastructure has been debugged), which is small &amp; shallow compared to what’s possible, on tiny data (fits on a laptop), sampled in a dumb way⁠, its benchmark performance sabotaged by bad prompts &amp; data encoding problems (especially arithmetic &amp; commonsense reasoning), and yet, the first version already manifests crazy runtime meta-learning—and the scaling curves <em>still</em> are not bending!</p></div></blockquote><p>Still, extrapolating ML performance is problematic because it&#39;s inevitably an extrapolation of performance on a particular set of benchmarks. Lukas Finnveden, for example, <a href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/k2SNji3jXaLGhBeYP/extrapolating-gpt-n-performance#Takeaways_and_conclusions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argues</a> that a model similar to GPT-3 but 100x larger could reach &quot;optimal&quot; performance on the relevant benchmarks. But would optimal performance correspond to an agentic, superhuman, general intelligence? What we&#39;re really interested is surprising performances in hard-to-measure domains, long-term planning, etc. So while these benchmarks might be suggestive (especially compared to human performance on the same benchmark), and may offer some useful clues in terms of scaling performance, I don&#39;t think we can rely too much on them—the error bars are wide in both directions.</p><h3 id="Brains"><a href="#Brains" class="headerlink" title="Brains"></a>Brains</h3><p>The human brain is an existence proof not only for the possibility of general intelligence, but also for the existence of a process—evolution—that can design general intelligences with no knowledge of how minds operate. The brain and its evolution offer some hints about what it takes to build a general intelligence:</p><ul><li>Number of synapses in the brain.</li><li>Computational power (~1e15 FLOPS/s).</li><li>Energy consumption (~20 watts).</li><li>Required computation for the training of individual brains.</li><li>Required evolutionary &quot;computation&quot; to generate brains.</li></ul><p>The most straight-forward comparison is synapses to parameters. GPT-3 has 1.75e11 parameters compared to ~1e15 synapses in the brain, so it&#39;s still 4 orders of magnitude off, and a model parameter is not a perfect analogue to a synapse, so this is more of an extreme lower limit rather than a mean estimate.</p><p>The brain also presents some interesting problems when it comes to scaling, as some aspects of human evolution suggest the scaling hypothesis might be wrong. While the human brain got bigger during the last few million years, it&#39;s only about 3-4x the size of a chimpanzee brain—compare to the orders of magnitude we&#39;re talking about in ML. On the other hand, if we look at individual differences today, brain volume and IQ <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289616303385" target="_blank" rel="noopener">correlate at ~0.4</a>. Not a very strong correlation, but it does suggest that you can just throw more neurons at a problem and get better results.</p><p>How do we reconcile these facts pointing in different directions? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moravec%27s_paradox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sensorimotor skills are expensive</a> and brain size scales with body mass: whales might have massive brains compared to us, but that doesn&#39;t give them anywhere near the same intellectual capabilities. So what appears to be a relatively small increase compared to chimps is actually a large increase in brain volume not dedicated to sensorimotor abilities.</p><img src="/images/twopaths_brainsize-d4d2b539921b9b13e46b7f523ad5e6c7.png"><h3 id="How-much-power-will-we-have"><a href="#How-much-power-will-we-have" class="headerlink" title="How much power will we have?"></a>How much power will we have?</h3><p>Compute use has increased by about 10 orders of magnitude in the last 20 years, and that growth has <em>accelerated</em> lately, currently <a href="https://openai.com/blog/ai-and-compute/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doubling approximately every 3.5 months</a>. A big lesson from the pandemic is that people are bad at reasoning about exponential curves, so let&#39;s put it in a different way: training GPT-3 cost approximately 0.000005%<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn5567868315" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref5567868315">5</sup></a></span> of world GDP. Go on, count the zeroes. Count the orders of magnitude. Do the math! There is plenty of room for scaling, if it works.</p><p>The main constraint is government willingness to fund AI projects. If they take it seriously, we can probably get 6 orders of magnitude just by spending more money. GPT-3 took 3.14e23 FLOPs to train, so if strong AGI can be had for less than 1e30 FLOPs it might happen soon. Realistically any such project would have to start by building fabs to make the chips needed, so even if we started today we&#39;re talking 5+ years at the earliest.</p><p>Looking into the near future, I&#39;d predict that by 2040 we could squeeze another 1-2 orders of magnitude out of hardware improvements. Beyond that, growth in available compute would slow down to the level of economic growth plus hardware improvements.</p><h3 id="Putting-it-all-together"><a href="#Putting-it-all-together" class="headerlink" title="Putting it all together"></a>Putting it all together</h3><p>The best attempt at AGI forecasting I know of is Ajeya Cotra&#39;s heroic 4-part 168-page <em><a href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/KrJfoZzpSDpnrv9va/draft-report-on-ai-timelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forecasting TAI with biological anchors</a></em>. She breaks down the problem into a number of different approaches, then combines the resulting distributions into a single forecast. The resulting distribution is appropriately wide: we&#39;re not talking about ±15% but ±15 orders of magnitude.</p><p>Her results can be summarized in two charts. First, the distribution of how many FLOPs it will take to train a &quot;transformative&quot; AI:</p><img src="/images/twopaths_flopsrequired-f292f0e3d48c3172a2a4c0869ecc1dc7.png"><p>I highly recommend checking out Cotra&#39;s work if you&#39;re interested in the details behind each of those forecasts. This distribution is then combined with projections of our computational capacity to generate AI timelines. Cotra&#39;s estimate (which I find plausible) is ~30% by 2040, ~50% by 2050, and ~80% by 2100:</p><img src="/images/twopaths_cotraprob-8c49ef83959119254c80ce358f5503e7.png"><p>Metaculus has a couple of questions on AGI, and the answers are quite similar to Cotra&#39;s projections. <a href="https://www.metaculus.com/questions/384/human-machine-intelligence-parity-by-2040/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This question</a> is about &quot;human-machine intelligence parity&quot; as judged by three graduate students; the community gives a 54% chance of it happening by 2040. <a href="https://www.metaculus.com/questions/3479/when-will-the-first-artificial-general-intelligence-system-be-devised-tested-and-publicly-known-of/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This one</a> is based on the Turing test, the SAT, and a couple of ML benchmarks, and the median prediction is 2038, with an 83% chance of it coming before 2100. Here&#39;s the cumulative probability chart:</p><img src="/images/twopaths_aiprob-d57c12266c168970fdd79b5842623a40.png"><p>Both extremes should be taken into account: we must prepare for the possibility that AI will arrive very soon, while also tending to our long-term problems in case it takes more than a century.</p><h1 id="Human-Enhancement"><a href="#Human-Enhancement" class="headerlink" title="Human Enhancement"></a>Human Enhancement</h1><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>All things change in a dynamic environment. Your effort to remain what you are is what limits you.</p></div></blockquote><p>The second path to the future involves making better humans. Ignoring the AI control question for a moment, better humans would be incredibly valuable to the rest of us purely for the positive externalities of their intelligence: smart people produce benefits for everyone else in the form of greater innovation, faster growth, and better governance. The main constraint to growth is intelligence, and small differences cause large effects: a standard deviation in national averages is the difference between a cutting-edge technological economy and not having reliable water and power. While capitalism has ruthlessly optimized the productivity of everything around us, the single most important input—human labor—has remained stagnant. Unlocking this potential would create unprecedented levels of growth.</p><p>Above all, transhumanism might give us a fighting chance against AI. How likely are they to win that fight? I have no idea, but their odds must be better than ours. The pessimistic scenario is that enhanced humans are still limited by numbers and meat, while artificial intelligences are only limited by energy and efficiency, both of which could potentially scale quickly.</p><p>The most important thing to understand about the race between DNA and silicon is that there&#39;s a long lag to human enhancement. Imagine the best-case scenario in which we start producing enhanced humans <em>today</em>: how long until they start seriously contributing? 20, 25 years? They would not be competing against the AI of today, but against the AI from 20-25 years in the future. Regardless of the method we choose, if superhuman AGI arrives in 2040, it&#39;s already too late. If it arrives in 2050, we have a tiny bit of wiggle room.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn5567868316" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref5567868316">6</sup></a></span></p><p>Let&#39;s take a look at our options.</p><h3 id="Normal-Breeding-with-Selection-for-Intelligence"><a href="#Normal-Breeding-with-Selection-for-Intelligence" class="headerlink" title="Normal Breeding with Selection for Intelligence"></a>Normal Breeding with Selection for Intelligence</h3><p>Way too slow and extraordinarily unpopular.</p><h3 id="Gene-Editing"><a href="#Gene-Editing" class="headerlink" title="Gene Editing"></a>Gene Editing</h3><p>With our current technology, editing is not relevant. It&#39;s probably fine for very simple edits, but intelligence is a massively polygenic trait and would require far too many changes. However, people are working on multiplex editing, reducing the odds of off-target edits, etc. Perhaps eventually we will even be able to introduce entirely new sequences with large effects, bypassing the polygenicity problem. More realistically, in a couple of decades editing might be a viable option, and it does have the benefit of letting people have their own kids in a relatively normal way (except better).</p><h3 id="Cyborgs"><a href="#Cyborgs" class="headerlink" title="Cyborgs"></a>Cyborgs</h3><p>Seems unlikely to work. Even if we solve the interface problem it&#39;s unclear how a computer without superhuman general reasoning capabilities could enhance the important parts of human thought to superhuman levels. If, instead of relying on the independent capabilities of an external computer, a hypothetical brain-computer interface could act as a brain &quot;expander&quot; adding more synapses, that might work, but it seems extremely futuristic even compared to the other ideas in this post. Keep in mind even our largest (slowest, most expensive) neural networks are still tiny compared to brains.</p><h3 id="Iterated-Embryo-Selection"><a href="#Iterated-Embryo-Selection" class="headerlink" title="Iterated Embryo Selection"></a>Iterated Embryo Selection</h3><p>The basic idea is to do IVF, sequence the embryos, select the best one, and then instead of implanting the embryo, you use its DNA for another round of IVF. Iteration adds enormous value compared to simply picking the best embryos: <a href="https://www.nickbostrom.com/papers/embryo.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shulman and Bostrom</a> estimate that single-stage selection of 1 in 1000 embryos would add 24.3 IQ points on average. On the other hand, 10 generations of 1-in-10 selection would add ~130 points. On top of the IQ gains we could also optimize other traits (health, longevity, altruism) at the same time. This is the method with the highest potential gains, as the only limit would be physiological or computational. And IES wouldn&#39;t be starting at 100: if we use Nobel laureates, we&#39;ve already got ~3 SDs in the bag.</p><p>How far can IES go? There are vast amounts of variation for selection to work on, and therefore vast room for improvement over the status quo. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032579119385505" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Selection for weight in broiler chickens</a> has resulted in rapid gain of 10+ standard deviations, and I believe we can expect similar results for selection on intelligence. Chicken size is probably not a perfect parallel to intelligence, and I&#39;m sure that eventually we will start hitting some limits as additivity starts to fail or physical limitations impose themselves. But I don&#39;t think there are any good reasons to think that these limits are close to the current distribution of human intelligence.</p><p>However, there are some problems:</p><ul><li>IVF is expensive and has a low success rate.</li><li>Gametogenesis from stem cells isn&#39;t there yet (but people <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27257761/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are</a> <a href="https://academic.oup.com/biolreprod/article-abstract/100/4/885/5247713?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-3027-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on</a> <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6412/356" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it</a>).</li><li>Sequencing every embryo still costs ~$500 and our PGSs<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn5567868317" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref5567868317">7</sup></a></span> aren&#39;t great yet.</li><li>The process might still take several months per generation.</li></ul><p>None of these are insoluble. Sequencing costs are dropping rapidly, and even with today&#39;s prices the costs aren&#39;t that bad: gwern estimates <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Embryo-selection#iterated-embryo-selection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$9k per IQ point</a>. He says it&#39;s expensive, but it would be very easily worth it from a societal perspective. The biggest downside is the time it would take: say 5 years to make IES tech viable, another 5 years for 10 rounds of selection,<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn5567868318" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref5567868318">8</sup></a></span> and we&#39;re at 2050 before they&#39;re grown up. Still, it&#39;s definitely worth pursuing, at the very least as a backup strategy. After all there&#39;s still a good chance we won&#39;t reach superhuman AGI by 2050.</p><p>How likely is any of this to happen? Metaculus is very pessimistic even on simple IVF selection for IQ, let alone IES, with the median prediction for the <a href="https://www.metaculus.com/questions/5525/ivf-based-embryo-selection-for-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first 100 IQ-selected babies being the year 2036</a>.

Perhaps I&#39;m underestimating the taboo against selecting on IQ, but even then there&#39;s a whole world out there, many different cultures with fewer qualms. Then again, not even China used human challenge trials against covid.</p><h3 id="Cloning"><a href="#Cloning" class="headerlink" title="Cloning"></a>Cloning</h3><p>I believe the best choice is cloning.

You could do a bunch of other people too, diversity of talents and interests and so on, but really let&#39;s just start with a bunch of JvNs.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn55678683110" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref55678683110">10</sup></a></span></p><p>Why JvN? Lots of Nobel laureates in physics were awed by his intelligence (Hans Bethe said his brain indicated &quot;a species superior to that of man&quot;). He was creative, flexible, and interested in a fairly wide array of fields (including computing and artificial intelligence).<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn55678683111" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref55678683111">11</sup></a></span> He was stable and socially competent. And he had the kind of cosmic ambition that we seem to be lacking these days: &quot;All processes that are stable we shall predict. All processes that are unstable we shall control.&quot; As for downsides: he died young of cancer,<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn55678683112" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref55678683112">12</sup></a></span> he was not particularly photogenic, and he loved to eat and <a href="https://qualiacomputing.com/2018/06/21/john-von-neumann/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thought exercise was &quot;nonsense&quot;</a>.</p><p>There are commercial dog- and horse-cloning operations <em>today</em>. We&#39;ve even cloned <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/01/these-monkey-twins-are-first-primate-clones-made-method-developed-dolly" target="_blank" rel="noopener">primates</a>. The costs, frankly, are completely trivial. A cloned horse costs $85k! Undoubtedly the first JvN would cost much more than that, but since we&#39;re making a million of them we can expect economies of scale. I bet we could do it for $200 billion, or less than half what the US has spent on the F35 thus far. Compared to the predicted cost of training superhuman AGI, the cost of one million JvNs is at the extreme lower end of the AI forecasts, about 5 orders of magnitude above GPT-3.</p><p>Let&#39;s try to quantify the present value of a JvN, starting with a rough and extremely conservative estimate: say von Neumann had an IQ of 180<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn55678683113" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref55678683113">13</sup></a></span> and we clone a million of them. Due to regression to the mean, the average clone will be less intelligent than the original; assuming heritability of .85, we&#39;d expect an average IQ of 168. This would increase average US IQ by 0.21 points. Going by <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=552481" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jones &amp; Schneider&#39;s</a> estimate of a 6% increase in GDP per point in national IQ, we might expect about 1.26% higher output. If the effect was immediate, that would be about $270 billion per year, but we should probably expect a few decades before it took effect. Even this extremely modest estimate puts the value of a JvN at about $270k <em>per year</em>. Assuming the JvNs become productive after 20 years, affect GDP for 50 years, 2% GDP growth, and a 3% discount rate, the present value of a JvN is around $8.4 million. The cost:benefit ratio is off the charts.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn55678683114" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref55678683114">14</sup></a></span></p><p>However, I think this is a significant under-estimate. Intuitively, we would expect that governance and innovation are more heavily influenced by the cognitive elite rather than the mean. And there is <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0260107918761923" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decent</a> <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.397.4281&rep=rep1&type=pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">empirical evidence</a> to support this view, generally showing that the elite is more important. As <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/213987217.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kodila-Tedika, Rindermann &amp; Christainsen</a> put it, &quot;cognitive capitalism is built upon intellectual classes.&quot; One problem with these studies is that they only look at the 95th percentile of the IQ distribution, but what we really care about here is the 99.9th percentile. And there are no countries with a million 170+ IQ people, so the best we can do is extrapolate from slight deviations from the normal distribution.</p><p>Another piece of evidence worth looking at is <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0963721410391442" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robertson et al.&#39;s</a> data on outcomes among the top 1% within the US. They took boys with IQs above the 99th percentile and split them into four groups (99.00-99.25th percentile, etc.), then looked at the outcomes of each group:</p><img src="/images/twopaths_99thiq-0b501f7526b80f2577a278dd3e49d7de.png"><p>Simply going from an IQ of ~135 (99th percentile) to ~142+ (99.75th percentile) has enormous effects in terms of income, innovation, and science. Extrapolate that to 168. Times a million. However, the only variable here that&#39;s directly quantifiable in dollar terms is &gt;95th percentile income and what we&#39;re <em>really</em> interested in are the externalities. Undoubtedly the innovation that goes into those patents, and the discoveries that go into those publications create societal value. But putting that value into numbers is difficult. If I had to make a wild guess, I&#39;d multiply our naïve $8.4 million estimate by 5, for a present value of $42 million per JvN.</p><p>That is all assuming a permanent increase in the <em>level</em> of output. A more realistic estimate would include faster <em>growth</em>. Beyond the faster growth due to their discoveries and innovations, the JvNs would also 1) help make genetic enhancement universal (even light forms like single-stage embryo selection would increase world GDP by several multiples) and, most importantly, 2) accelerate progress toward superhuman AI, and (hopefully) tame it. To take a wild guess at how much closer the JvNs would bring us to AGI: they would give us an order of magnitude more in spending, an order of magnitude faster hardware, and an order of magnitude better training algorithms, for a total increase in effective computational resources of 1000x. Here&#39;s how Cotra&#39;s average AI timeline would be accelerated, assuming the JvNs deploy that extra power between 2045 and 2055:</p><img src="/images/twopaths_jvnvscotratimelines-59318808b59cafbd9065954e748593f7.png"><p>US GDP growth has averaged about 2.9% in the 21st century; suppose the JvNs triple the growth rate for the rest of the century:<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn55678683115" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref55678683115">15</sup></a></span> it would result in a cumulative increase in output with a present value of approximately $9 quadrillion, or $9 billion per JvN.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn55678683116" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref55678683116">16</sup></a></span></p><p>At a time when we&#39;re spending trillions on projects with comically negative NPV, this is probably the best investment a government could possibly make. It&#39;s also an investment that will almost certainly never come from the private sector because the benefits are impossible to capture for a private entity.</p><p>Would there be declining marginal value to JvNs? It seems likely, as there&#39;s only so much low-hanging fruit they could pick before the remaining problems became too difficult for them. And a JvN intellectual monoculture might miss things that a more varied scientific ecosystem would catch. That would be an argument for intellectual diversity in our cloning efforts. Assuming interests are highly heritable we should probably also re-create leading biologists, chemists, engineers, entrepreneurs, and so on.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn55678683117" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref55678683117">17</sup></a></span> On the other hand there might be o-ring style <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11406-020-00189-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">network effects</a> which push in the opposite direction. There&#39;s also a large literature on how industrial clusters boost productivity and create economies of scale; perhaps there are such clusters in scientific output as well.</p><p>As for the problems with this idea: human cloning has about the same <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/6028/cloning.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approval rating</a> that Trump has among Democrats.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn55678683118" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref55678683118">18</sup></a></span> We can expect the typical trouble with implanting embryos.

Expecting septuagenarian politicians to anticipate wild technological changes and do something incredibly expensive and unpopular today for a hypothetical benefit that may or may not materialize decades down the line—is simply not realistic. Right now from a government perspective these questions might as well not exist; politicians live in the current paradigm and expect it to continue indefinitely. On the other hand, the Manhattan Project shows us that immediate existential threats have the power to get things moving very quickly. In 1939, Fermi estimated a 10% probability that a nuclear bomb could be built; 6 years later it was being dropped on Japan.</p><p>My guess is that some event makes AI/transhumanism (geo)politically salient, which will trigger a race between the US and China, causing an enormous influx of money.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn55678683119" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref55678683119">19</sup></a></span> Perhaps something like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein%E2%80%93Szil%C3%A1rd_letter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Einstein–Szilárd letter</a>, perhaps some rogue scientist doing something crazy.
