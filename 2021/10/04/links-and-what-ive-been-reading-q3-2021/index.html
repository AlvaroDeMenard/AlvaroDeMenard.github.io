Re-read. What was that Coleridge quip? &quot;All men are born Herodotians or Thucydideans&quot;? Something like that. Anyway, I was definitely born a Herodotian. Thucydides is a historian with the soul of an accountant. Still, there are things to appreciate in that attitude: while most ancient historians never saw an army smaller than 400,000, he&#39;s happy to tell you about engagements with 60 hoplites and 20 archers. And keeping track of a myriad engagements, covering Asia Minor, Greece, and Italy, over the span of multiple decades is extremely impressive.</p><p>How prescriptive is Thuc&#39;s realpolitik? I&#39;m not entirely sure, it certainly didn&#39;t do the Athenians any good. He&#39;s obviously a skeptic when it comes to the supernatural, and there&#39;s very little room for morality in his history; is this an artifact of the lack of morality in the way the Athenian went about their affairs, or is this something Thuc projects onto them? One interesting point is that his story draws on the structure of tragedy: the hubris of the Sicilian expedition is ultimately punished; the players seem to lack any ability to change course. Perhaps morality plays no role in this history because Thuc views the path taken by each polis as <em>deterministic</em>. (This applies both to the &quot;Thucydides trap&quot; specifically, and also more generally).</p><p>On the question of direct democracy as a system of government things are a bit clearer as Thuc doesn&#39;t hide his views. He&#39;s short on alternatives though; the traditional polis obviously can&#39;t cope with the environment of the 4th century, but Thuc can&#39;t really see beyond it.</p><p>There are apparently some people who think Thucydides influenced the Neoconservatives, and I find that utterly absurd. Thuc is extraordinarily cynical when it comes to &quot;spreading freedom&quot;-style justifications for war, and if there&#39;s any realpolitik involved in spending trillions so that Afghan women can get gender studies degrees for 20 years before the Taliban come back, I&#39;m not seeing it.</p><p>One of the things that stand out is how bad the Greeks are at war. Reading Thuc, you&#39;re constantly thinking &quot;well of course these guys got rolled by the Romans&quot;. How did they beat the Persians so hard? Sieges seem to be a sticking point (something Phillip II turned out to be quite good at), so perhaps the open battles against the Persians played into their hands, or perhaps it was simply a matter of mismatched unit compositions. On the other hand the Athenians were extraordinarily persistent; even after the plague and the Sicilian disaster they still kept going for years, possibly only losing due to the Persian money flowing into the Spartan coffers.</p><p>If you haven&#39;t read any histories of the Pelopponesian war, this is highly recommended, just keep in mind it&#39;s very unfinished.

This book has an incredibly ambitious thesis: it argues that the world became modern due to the rediscovery of Lucretius&#39; <em>De Rerum Natura</em>. Unfortunately the evidence presented in favor of that thesis is pretty weak, and the book suddenly ends right as it starts to get into a groove. Still, it&#39;s fairly entertaining and has a ton of interesting anecdotes from the life of Poggio Bracciolini (the man who rediscovered Lucretius).</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Origin-Species-Everymans-Library-Classics/dp/1857152581?dchild=1&keywords=The+Origin+of+Species+everyman&qid=1633048213&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=c81c68353744c2314526516fb2bcf178&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Origin of Species</a></strong>, by Charles Darwin. A fairly dry read, its value today mainly lies in its documentation of the discovery of evolution, and in showing how Darwin could reason his way forward despite rather limited means (not even an inkling of DNA!). It was cool to see the role geology played in the development of evolutionary theory, and there&#39;s a very interesting passage (at the end of the chapter ON THE IMPERFECTION OF THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD) in which Darwin <em>almost</em> invents plate tectonics based on the geographical distribution of species. It&#39;s difficult to recommend: if you want to learn about evolution, pick up a modern textbook; if you&#39;re interested in the history of science you should probably read a historian; and if you just want to read something cool by Charles Darwin, pick up his Beagle adventure.</p></li></ul><h3 id="Fiction"><a href="#Fiction" class="headerlink" title="Fiction"></a>Fiction</h3><ul><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Upon-Deep-Zones-Thought/dp/0812515285?&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=4cd132bb2522294b09d8f5180751101d&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Fire Upon the Deep</a></strong>, by Vernor Vinge. Some pretty cool worldbuilding, with a universe divided into zones where different levels of technology are possible (the highest one is filled with Gods who quickly commit --suicide). One of the main alien races is a sentient houseplant riding a roomba (seriously). But half the novel is wasted on a dull isekai story about some annoying kids stuck on a backwards planet with telepathic wolves, making the thing way overlong. And the resolution is not entirely satisfying.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Inhibitor-Phase-Revelation-Alastair-Reynolds/dp/0316462764?dchild=1&keywords=inhibitor+phase&qid=1633048042&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=922b0ca67e81dd8eb47848002ac2c438&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inhibitor Phase</a></strong>, by Alastair Reynolds. A new novel in the Revelation Space universe, unfortunately it&#39;s also the worst novel in the Revelation Space universe. It&#39;s a bit like a horror theme park, going from one ride to the next with little to no connective tissue between them. Even worse, many of the rides are completely nonsensical given the setting (humanity has almost been completely wiped out by the inhibitors). The two main characters are completely uninteresting, their dialogue is annoying, and the revelations of their backstory are completely predictable.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Crash-Novel-J-G-Ballard/dp/1250171512?dchild=1&keywords=ballard+crash&qid=1633048060&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=a0b770f15340f6bf85f8a5bfec194335&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crash</a></strong>, by J. G. Ballard. Holy mother of Christ, this is an experience. A blunt tool that beats you into submission through drone-like repetitiveness. Truly a novel that lives up to its reputation (one publisher&#39;s reader wrote: &quot;This author is beyond psychiatric help. Do Not Publish!&quot;). What images! A peerless examination of the intersection between sex and technology. The Cronenberg film gets the imagery right, but the languid, whispered tempo is completely wrong. Kermode, in a very positive review, described it as &quot;glacial&quot;! I feel the novel required a more in-your-face treatment.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>He dreamed of ambassadorial limousines crashing into jack-knifing butane tankers, of taxis filled with celebrating children colliding head-on below the bright display windows of deserted supermarkets. He dreamed of alienated brothers and sisters, by chance meeting each other on collision courses on the access roads of petrochemical plants, their unconscious incest made explicit in this colliding metal, in the heamorrhages of their brain tissue flowering beneath the aluminized compression chambers and reactions vessels.</p></div></blockquote></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lord-Flies-William-Golding/dp/0399501487?dchild=1&keywords=lord+of+the+flies&qid=1633048137&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=5bb57c55c80d3980c7921f73381602ca&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lord of the Flies</a></strong>, by William Golding. Somehow managed to evade this as a kid. It&#39;s compelling and effective but I can&#39;t get on board with its overwhelming cynicism.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://zerohplovecraft.wordpress.com/2021/07/07/dont-make-me-think/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Don&#39;t Make Me Think</a></strong>, by Zero HP Lovecraft.

Flashman&#39;s in China this time, right in the middle of the Taiping Rebellion. This is the 8th book in the series, and things are starting to get repetitive, but the humor, deep historical research, and memorable characters manage to overcome the familiar plotline.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Shadow of the Wind</strong>. by Carlos Ruiz Zafón.
