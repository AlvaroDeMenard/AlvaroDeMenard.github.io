&quot;carbon footprint&quot; is an <a href="https://mashable.com/feature/carbon-footprint-pr-campaign-sham/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">oil company psyop</a>. About 20 years ago, British Petroleum launched an ad campaign popularizing the notion and put out a website letting you calculate your &quot;carbon footprint&quot;. They&#39;re <a href="https://www.knowyourcarbonfootprint.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still at it</a>.</p><img src="/images/ibs_carbon_footprint-d8eccf802857986099b62b7ec5ccbdc1.png"><p>It&#39;s an idea with remarkable memetic power, both for individuals and brands. Displaying your concern about your personal carbon footprint lets you show off your prosociality and marks you out as someone virtuous, someone who takes personal responsibility. The idea also feeds into people&#39;s narcissistic tendencies, reassuring them that they&#39;re actually important and that their actions matter in the world.</p><p>Marketers love the concept, and any company trying to appeal to the nature-loving demographic can use and abuse it: <a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/outdoor-brands-get-serious-about-carbon-footprint-adventure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Outdoor Brands Get Serious About the Carbon Footprint of Adventure: The North Face and Protect Our Winters unveil an activism-oriented CO2 calculator</a>.</p><p>The problem with all of this, and the reason BP pushed the idea in the first place, is that your personal carbon footprint doesn&#39;t matter. You&#39;re 1 of about 7.6 billion people on earth, so your effect is about 1/7,600,000,000 ≈ 0.000000013%. Your personal carbon footprint is completely irrelevant to climate change. Global warming is a collective issue that requires collective solutions; framing it as a problem that <em>individuals</em> can tackle (and that individuals are responsible for) distracts from the <em>public</em> policy changes that are necessary. Environmentalist signaling is complete nonsense but also deadly serious.</p><h2 id="The-Parallel"><a href="#The-Parallel" class="headerlink" title="The Parallel"></a>The Parallel</h2><p>Caring about individual bad studies is a bit like caring about your individual carbon footprint.</p><p>People occasionally send me shitty papers, and year or two ago I would care a lot, enjoying the shameful thrill of getting Mad Online about some fraud, or having fun picking apart yet another terrible study. It&#39;s an attractive activity, and performing it in public shows how much you care about Good Science. Picking out a single paper to replicate operates at the same level. What&#39;s the impact of all this?</p><p>In the idealized version of science, a replication failure would raise serious doubts about the veracity of the original study and have all sorts of downstream effects. In the real version of social science, none of that matters. You have to go on active memetic warfare if you want to have any effect, and even then there&#39;s no guarantee you&#39;ll succeed. As Tal Yarkoni puts it, &quot;<a href="https://twitter.com/talyarkoni/status/1427972323068583943" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the dominant response is some tut-tutting and mild expression of indignation, and then everything reverts to status quo until the next case</a>&quot;. People <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20136577/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keep citing retracted articles</a>. Brian fucking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Wansink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wansink</a> has been getting over 7 citations <em>per day</em> in 2021. So what exactly do you think a replication is going to achieve?</p><p><strong>Walker</strong></p><p>A couple years ago Alexey Guzey wrote &quot;<a href="https://guzey.com/books/why-we-sleep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew Walker&#39;s &quot;Why We Sleep&quot; Is Riddled with Scientific and Factual Errors</a>&quot;, finding not only errors but even egregious data manipulation in Walker&#39;s book. Guzey later collaborated with Andrew Gelman on <a href="https://www.gwern.net/docs/statistics/bias/2020-gelman.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Statistics as Squid Ink: How Prominent Researchers Can Get Away with Misrepresenting Data</a>.</p><p>What was the effect of all this?

We might make a similar argument about longtermism in social science: the vast majority of papers lie in the future. If we can do something today to improve them even by a little bit, the cumulative impact would be enormous. On the other hand, defeating one of the 10,000 bad papers that will be published this year is not going to do much at all. Effective scientific altruism is systematically improving the future by 0.01% rather than putting your energy into deboonking a single study. Every dollar wasted on replication is a dollar that could&#39;ve been invested in fixing the underlying collective problems instead. The past is not going to change, but the future is still malleable.</p><p>Ideally we&#39;d proclaim the beginning of a new era, ban citations to any pre-2022 works, and start from scratch (except actually do things properly this time).
