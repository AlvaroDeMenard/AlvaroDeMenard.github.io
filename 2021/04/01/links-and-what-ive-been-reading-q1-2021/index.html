Yes, they do a lot of conscious p-hacking, but this does not seem like cheating to them. Rather, these researchers have the attitude that research methods and statistics are a bunch of hoops to jump through, some paperwork along the lines of the text formatting you need for a grant submission or the forms you need to submit to the IRB. From these researchers’ standpoint, they already know the truth; they just need to do the experiment to prove it.

A few months back I read John Mandeville&#39;s fanciful travelogue; this is from the same time (mid 14th century), but completely different: grounded, realistic, and focused on the world of Islam.

Reflects and contains nature both in its form and content. I picked it up it because Werner Herzog recommended it and it is indeed very Herzogian.

Based on historical fact: Sade really did direct plays while held at the asylum of Charenton, and they were quite popular. This is one of those plays that&#39;s probably better seen than read, as it&#39;s filled with song and music and elaborate stage instructions. The movie by Peter Brook is good. In the afterword Weiss claims he&#39;s trying to reclaim Marat from the &quot;bourgeois historians&quot; but in those terms it&#39;s a complete failure. His Sade on the other hand evokes a delightful Lovecraftian cosmic nihilism.

Re-read, not quite as good as I remembered it. An experimental novel about a group of bohemians in Paris. The first half is excellent, the gimmick of the &quot;expendable chapters&quot; works well, and some moments are absolute perfection (in one chapter the main character writes a letter between the lines of a book, and we get to read both the letter and the book on alternate lines; then there&#39;s <em>that</em> unforgettable scene in the apartment). But the novel kind of disintegrates in the second half, when Oliveira gets back to Argentina.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cognitive-Capitalism-Capital-Wellbeing-Nations/dp/1107651085?dchild=1&keywords=Cognitive+Capitalism%3A+Human+Capital+and+the+Wellbeing+of+Nations&qid=1617024087&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=09aad755cb6e0eaaca6e05f55997c2c4&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cognitive Capitalism: Human Capital and the Wellbeing of Nations</a></strong> by Heiner Rindermann. Skimmed. Mostly a retread of his papers. Final chapter with comparisons to Mokyr, Clark, Acemoglu, Diamond, Hanushek, etc. was interesting.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evolutionary-Limits-Liberalism-Democratic-Satisfaction/dp/3030314952?dchild=1&keywords=The+Evolutionary+Limits+of+Liberalism&qid=1617024494&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=dce12962a8e080a20ad965046ec480e7&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Evolutionary Limits of Liberalism</a></strong> by Filipe Nobre Faria. A rather strange book, in which the focus is arguing against individualism in general and public choice theory in particular, based on their disregard for group selectionism. The idea is that groups of selfish rational agents lose to altruistic groups in the long run. A very abstract call for a morality that is pro-group cohesion, pro-altruism, anti-markets. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3860099142" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slightly longer review</a>.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Three-Novels-Molloy-Malone-Unnamable/dp/0802144470?dchild=1&keywords=Molloy&qid=1617024042&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=d84098144fdfbc840ce9dcf21adc0d8f&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Molloy</a></strong> by Samuel Beckett. Beckett wrote it originally in French, &quot;because in French it’s easier to write without style&quot;, then translated it into English. The resulting language fits perfectly into this captivating experimental enigma of a novel. Don&#39;t expect much in terms of plot, scenes, dialogue, or most of the usual trappings of the novel. Long stretches don&#39;t even bother with paragraphs. Decay, aging, disability, confusion, vagrancy, and all sorts of strange obsessions. Often funny, somehow. A double quest that may or may not be a parallel, a loop, or something completely different.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Three-Novels-Molloy-Malone-Unnamable/dp/0802144470?dchild=1&keywords=Malone&qid=1617024042&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=d84098144fdfbc840ce9dcf21adc0d8f&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Malone Dies</a></strong> by Samuel Beckett. The second entry in the trilogy. Aging, misery, the process of dying. <em>Molloy</em> was already sparse, but <em>Malone Dies</em> goes even further, doing away with the humor and any semblance of linearity. Abstract and amorphous, like a novel dissolved in hydrochloric acid. Didn&#39;t capture me in the same way <em>Molloy</em> did.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Use-Weapons-Culture-Iain-Banks/dp/0316030570?dchild=1&keywords=Use+of+Weapons&qid=1617024168&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=fd53e658d85a032c1c05702f5eed0e3c&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Use of Weapons</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Excession-Iain-M-Banks/dp/185723457X?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1617024174&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=b4ef49f24cada444f26aaea69e377b2b&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Excession</a></strong> by Iain M. Banks. Both re-reads (first-time listens though). The audiobooks narrated by Peter Kenny are fantastic, he does different voices for every character and his style is perfect for space opera. <em>Use of Weapons</em> has two great characters at its core, but gets lost in a bazillion side-plots and flash-whatevers. <em>Excession</em> remains the best Culture book because of how ship-centric it is. I had completely forgotten the pointless subplot about the ditzy socialite, but luckily it doesn&#39;t ruin the rest of the book.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Revelation-Space-Inhibitor-Trilogy-1/dp/0316462446?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1617024213&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=e1a4b45eb1526d70a9c665a0b6952e27&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Revelation Space</a></strong> by Alastair Reynolds. Re-read. The audiobook is nowhere near as good as the Culture ones, but this is top-tier space opera. The adventures of an egomaniacal xenoarchaeologist and the insane posthuman crew of an ancient spaceship, as they get into galactic-scale trouble. Really nails the scale. Not 100% hard SF, but the fantastical elements are not <em>too</em> outlandish. There&#39;s a new novel in the Revelation Space series coming out soon.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Childhoods-End-Arthur-C-Clarke/dp/0345347951?dchild=1&keywords=Childhood%27s+End&qid=1617024133&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=8addb96caaa543355b84bd3107614ed9&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Childhood&#39;s End</a></strong> by Arthur C. Clarke. An incredibly silly relic from the cold war. Silly aliens, silly utopias, and a very silly resolution that literally involves a séance and a ouija board! Very pessimistic about the future of humanity. Tries to go for that epic space-is-giant, humans-are-tiny-and-irrelevant feeling but it really didn&#39;t work for me.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Undaunted-Courage-Meriwether-Jefferson-American/dp/0684826976?dchild=1&keywords=undaunted+courage&qid=1617024463&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=176d2210d215ccb910e40d09926e412f&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West</a></strong> by Stephen E. Ambrose. Ambrose has come under attack for his rather cavalier attitude toward plagiarism and telling the truth, but he&#39;s undeniably a great storyteller. And it&#39;s pop history after all, not an academic tome. Despite some distracting jingoism and fanboyism he does a great job of documenting Lewis &amp; Clark&#39;s incredible adventure across the Rockies to the Pacific. It&#39;s almost unbelievable how peaceful their interactions with the Native Americans were, but you can also see the seeds of future conflict right away. Jefferson plays a big role and he was an incredibly cool figure. Not sure what to make of the pathetic and tragic ending to Lewis&#39;s life...<div class="subscribediv" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:250px;margin-top:30px"><form class="validate"
