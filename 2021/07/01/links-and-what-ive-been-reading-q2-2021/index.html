Vasari was a painter and architect who lived in the first half of the 16th century and personally knew many of the greats (including Michelangelo). In this gossipy collection of biographies he covers more than 180 artists, starting with Cimabue and Giotto in the 13thC and ending with Michelangelo and others who were still alive at the time of writing (like Titian and Jacopo Sansovino). The ideas of progress and renaissance are front and center: the great ancients, the decline in the middle ages, and finally the triumphant rebirth of art in his own era. Parts of it are excellent, but it can get a bit dry and repetitive when he describes various minor artists, so I probably wouldn&#39;t recommend the full 2000+ page unabridged version. There&#39;s a good two-part BBC documentary called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ31OKYtass" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Travels With Vasari</a>.

I was curious to see if there was anything in B&amp;R that Henrich failed to capture in his work, and the answer is broadly &quot;no&quot;, but there are a few interesting differences: while Henrich is rather triumphalist, B&amp;R take a much more skeptical view of cultural evolution (a Nietzschean perspective, though of course they don&#39;t cite him). Unfortunately most of the book is bogged down by a series of dull arguments against various opponents of cultural evolution. My recommendation would be to read <em>The Secret of Our Success</em>, then read just chapter 5 (&quot;Culture is Maladaptive&quot;) in this one.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href>Great Mambo Chicken and the Transhuman Condition</a></strong> by Ed Regis. A fun pot-pourri of hubristic futurist ideas (cryonics, space habitats, interstellar travel, and so on), and the wild eccentrics who come up with them (Bob Truax, Hans Moravec, Freeman Dyson). The subjects are fascinating, but the book is a bit disorganized and repetitive.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Essays-Aphorisms-Penguin-Classics-Schopenhauer/dp/0140442278?dchild=1&keywords=essays+and+aphorisms&qid=1624229654&s=books&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=d91838e667befe76771d77e648f183e4&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Essays and Aphorisms</a></strong> by Arthur Schopenhauer. Selections from <em>Parerga und Paralipomena</em>. Very funny, Schopenhauer would have been one hell of a twitter poaster. Surprisingly similar to the pragmatists in some respects. And a pessimistic inverse of Nietzsche in others: &quot;Between the spirit of Graeco-Roman paganism and the spirit of Christianity the real antithesis is that of affirmation and denial of the will to live – in which regard Christianity is in the last resort fundamentally in the right.&quot; Will be tackling <em>World as Will and Representation</em> soon-ish.</p></li><li><p><strong>Selected Writings</strong> by William Hazlitt. How pathetic the petty political polemics of the past appear to the present... I despise his style, especially in the political pieces: cheap bluster that aims only to dazzle, never to illuminate.

The non-political writings are much better—they are merely unreadable rather than actively offensive.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Literary Art of Edward Gibbon</strong> by Harold L. Bond.

On the dry/academic side of things in terms of its style. Ultimately feels a bit superficial: this guy said this, the other guy said that...but we never get a critical examination of the substance of the arguments. The key take-away is that the &quot;Austrian school&quot; focused mostly on humbleness before evolved institutions, and emphasized the necessity of limits in order to have practical freedom.</li></ul><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Failure-Not-Option-Mission-Control/dp/1439148813?keywords=Failure+Is+Not+an+Option%3A+Mission+Control+From+Mercury+to+Apollo+13+and+Beyond&qid=1623102624&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=da53dd4cbc7fda0d3ac15e0acdb8d033&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Failure Is Not an Option: Mission Control From Mercury to Apollo 13 and Beyond</a></strong> by Gene Kranz. Fascinating subject, but written in a dry, militaristic, PR-conscious style. Even the story of Apollo 13 can become almost boring when told in this manner. Focused entirely on the mission control perspective. The most interesting aspect is how uncredentialed and inexperienced everyone was, and how quickly the space program moved. Reminiscent of Napoleon after the revolution. Feels like they really got lucky sometimes. Genius in hiring?</li></ul><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/48-Laws-Power-Robert-Greene/dp/0140280197?dchild=1&keywords=The+48+Laws+of+Power&qid=1623100065&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=98c8eb55a36fa8b644d2bb8c9e6d5765&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The 48 Laws of Power</a></strong> by Robert Greene. For some reason I read a bunch of &quot;self-help&quot;(-adjacent) books. This one is really anodyne compared to what I was expecting. It&#39;s mostly famous as a book read by ruthless rappers, but it&#39;s just a bunch of amusing historical anecdotes plus a boatload of confirmation bias. Greene likes the history of Japanese tea ceremonies, France during the Ancien Régime and the revolution, ancient Rome and Greece, and even takes several stories from Giorgio Vasari! Above all he likes Baltasar Gracián, whose <em>The Pocket Oracle and Art of Prudence</em> I can heartily recommend.</li></ul><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Influence-Practice-Robert-B-Cialdini/dp/0205609996?keywords=Influence%3A+Science+and+Practice&qid=1623102735&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=0f085994a244956c28a359e176c9d104&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Influence: Science and Practice</a></strong> by Robert Cialdini. While <em>48 Laws of Power</em> presents itself as a manual of manipulation and <em>Influence</em> presents itself more as a disinterested scientific study, the former is actually about airy stories of kings and courtiers while the latter is a cynical dark arts manual for manipulating your coworkers. Make of that what you will. Repetitive &amp; overlong. Also, Cialdini loves to cite dubious social science papers—Milgram, Robber&#39;s Cave, etc. Still, the broad strokes are fairly convincing.</li></ul><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Presentation-Self-Everyday-Life/dp/0385094027?dchild=1&keywords=The+Presentation+of+Self+in+Everyday+Life&qid=1623102705&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=c9f86dd44cc22f3fcd83da20b92b08cd&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life</a></strong> by Erving Goffman. Class-signaling behaviors, profession-signaling behaviors, and so on, viewed through the lens of theatrical presentation. Rather one-sided, I feel it misses situations that can&#39;t be boiled down to actor-audience. Nothing really surprising, I think most people will have noticed most of this stuff. Also draws on many questionable historical examples (for example he repeatedly uses the Thugs to illustrate his points).</li></ul><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Impro-Improvisation-Theatre-Keith-Johnstone/dp/0878301178?dchild=1&keywords=Impro%3A+Improvisation+and+the+Theatre&qid=1623102660&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=9860c585fae205470e179b11773d73d9&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Impro: Improvisation and the Theatre</a></strong> by Keith Johnstone.

Cults, mass media, a reclusive author. Love the style, very impressionistic. Lots of great sentences and great paragraphs, unfortunately they do not combine to form a Great Novel, the ideas never coalesce into anything solid. DeLillo revisits many of his typical themes here: American foreign policy, terrorism, cults, etc. Rather presciently written in 1991, very pessimistic on the potentials of mass action. &quot;The future belongs to crowds.&quot;</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Libra-Contemporary-American-Fiction-DeLillo/dp/0140156046?dchild=1&keywords=libra+delillo&qid=1623099945&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=e60f828242f3b72add0362f51da7bf3a&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Libra</a></strong> by Don DeLillo. A semi-fictionalized biography of Lee Harvey Oswald, based on the CIA/Cuban exiles conspiracy theory of the JFK assassination. Somewhat conventional in its style, and Pynchonesque in its attitude: conspiracies, axes of control and influence, strange coincidences, overeager pattern-matching, taking liberties with history. It&#39;s lacking the humor though. There&#39;s also a kind of meta parallel story of an FBI agent trying to piece together all the evidence, meticulously going through even the tiniest element (much like DeLillo).

A collection of autobiographical vignettes about sex and relationships. Starts out extremely vulgar and extremely funny, ends up in deep ugliness and despair. A tragedy disguised as a comedy.

If you&#39;re interested in the extremes of experimental literature, this is a book for you. The novel at its most abstract and formless. Virtually no characters, plot, movement, imagery, dialogue, paragraphs, or really anything else you might normally associate with a novel. I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s a pleasurable read, but it&#39;s an interesting one at least. Isolation, existential loneliness, death.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Samuel-Beckett/dp/0802150667?keywords=beckett+how+it+is&qid=1624229564&s=books&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=bb5c9b918bb4d8f5ea8b219ebbf29ba5&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How It Is</a></strong> by Samuel Beckett. It can&#39;t possibly be sparser and more formless than <em>The Unnamable</em>, you think. But it is! Beckett does away even with coherent, full sentences in this one.

A fun space opera in a unique setting (an Aztec-Japanese space empire), focused on xenoarchaeology. Ancient aliens, some cool <em>Solaris</em>-like ideas, some really out-there imagery.

Wat. My reaction to this book is just pure bewilderment. I love Ada Palmer&#39;s blog, but wtf is going on here? Am I supposed to be laughing at the terrible narrator and his horrifically bad similes? Is it for children? The magical boy protagonist and philosophy 101 stuff certainly seems to indicate so. Or maybe &quot;young adults&quot;? What&#39;s with the nonsensical worldbuilding (an SF/fantasy future that worships 18th century philosophers, with absurd coincidences piled on top of each other)? And apparently none of the plot is resolved by the end of the book! The whole thing reminded me of the &quot;taxation of trade routes&quot; stuff from the prequels, and this image kept popping into my head:</p><img
