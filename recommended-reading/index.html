[6] This was the only reason why six legions were sent to Spain and a seventh had been conscripted there, so many powerful auxiliary forces had been readied, and commanders with such extensive military experience had been delegated there. [7] None of this had been intended for the pacification of Spain or to meet the needs of a province that had been peaceful for a long time and did not require help at all. [8] For the longest time all these measures were being prepared against Caesar. Against him, new kinds of military command had been established, so that the same man could both, at the gates of Rome, control the city&#39;s affairs and be in charge for so many years of two very warlike provinces without ever being there. [9] Against him, the laws governing magistracies had been changed so that men were not sent out to their provinces after they had served as praetors and consuls, as had always been the case, but now were vetted and chosen by only a few men. Against him, the excuse of advanced age had been completely disregarded, as men who had proved capable in previous wars were summoned back to lead armies. [10] Against him alone, the principle was not observed that had always been granted to all successful commanders, which was that those who had been fortunate in their achievements could return home and discharge their army with honor or certainly without disgrace. [11] He, however, had endured all this patiently and would go on doing so. Even now it was not his intention to keep the army he had taken away from his opponents—although he could do this easily—but merely to make sure that his enemies did not have an army they could use against him. [12] Therefore, as he had stated, they were to leave the provinces and dismiss their army. If this was done, Caesar would not harm anyone. This was the one and final condition for peace.</p></div></blockquote><p></p></div></div><br></li></ul></li><li>Essays<ul><li>Becker, Pfaff &amp; Rubin, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0014498316301085" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Causes and Consequences of the Protestant Reformation</a></li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 id="Philosophy"><a href="#Philosophy" class="headerlink" title="Philosophy"></a>Philosophy</h3><ul><li>Books<ul><li>Nietzsche: Everything<div class="collapsible"><a href="#collapsible-uuid-11" class="collapsebtn">Show Details <i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></a><div style="display:none" id="collapsible-uuid-11" class="collapsecontent"><p>We still live in a pre-Nietzschean society in the sense that his insights have not really penetrated public consciousness, so you have a lot to gain from studying him.

Evolution, cultural evolution, evolutionary ethics, the social vs the animalistic elements of our psychology, the sources of values, truth as a value, how should we value values, the implications of atheism, what methodologies must philosophers employ, and much more.

Let us leave such chatter and such bad taste to those who have nothing else to do but drag the past a few steps further through time and who never live in the present—which is to say the many, the great majority. We, however, <em>want to become those we are</em> — human beings who are new, unique, incomparable, who give themselves laws, who create themselves. To that end we must become the best learners and discoverers of everything that is lawful and necessary in the world: we must become <em>physicists</em> in order to be able to be <em>creators</em> in this sense—while hitherto all valuations and ideals have been based on ignorance of physics or were constructed so as to <em>contradict</em> it.

Sex, money, religion, technology, ideology, redistribution of wealth…a good novelist can’t ignore anything. And all this must take place within a coherent vision, grosso modo, of the world.

I was born in 1881 in the great and mighty empire of the Habsburg Monarchy, but you would look for it in vain on the map today; it has vanished without trace. I grew up in Vienna, an international metropolis for two thousand years, and had to steal away from it like a thief in the night before it was demoted to the status of a provincial German town. My literary work, in the language in which I wrote it, has been burnt to ashes in the country where my books made millions of readers their friends. So I belong nowhere now, I am a stranger or at the most a guest everywhere. Even the true home of my heart’s desire, Europe, is lost to me after twice tearing itself suicidally to pieces in fratricidal wars. Against my will, I have witnessed the most terrible defeat of reason and the most savage triumph of brutality in the chronicles of time. Never—and I say so not with pride but with shame—has a generation fallen from such intellectual heights as ours to such moral depths. In the brief interval between the time when I first began to grow a beard and today, when it is beginning to turn grey, more radical changes and transformations have taken place than in ten normal human generations, and we all feel: this is too much! My today is so different from all my yesterdays; I have risen and fallen so often, that I sometimes feel as if I had lived not just one but several completely different lives. When I say, without thinking, ‘my life’, I often find myself instinctively wondering which life. My life before the world wars, before the First or the Second World War, or my life today? Then again I catch myself saying, ‘my house’, and I am not sure which of my former homes I mean: my house in Bath, my house in Salzburg, my parental home in Vienna? Or I find myself saying that ‘at home’ we do this or that, by ‘we’ meaning Austrians, and remember, with a shock, that for some time I have been no more of an Austrian than I am an Englishman or an American; I am no longer organically bound to my native land and I never really fit into any other.</p></div></blockquote><p></p></div></div><br></li><li>Werner Herzog, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Werner-Herzog/dp/0061575542/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=Conquest+of+the+Useless&qid=1590853585&s=books&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=797caf81c44d2f81d2d42197284838dc&language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Conquest of the Useless</a><div class="collapsible"><a href="#collapsible-uuid-34" class="collapsebtn">Show Details <i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></a><div style="display:none" id="collapsible-uuid-34" class="collapsecontent"><p>Herzog&#39;s journals from the time he was making Fitzcarraldo.

Borderline experimental in places.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>A vision had seized hold of me, like the demented fury of a hound that has sunk its teeth into the leg of a deer carcass and is shaking and tugging at the downed game so frantically that the hunter gives up trying to calm him. It was the vision of a large steamship scaling a hill under its own steam, working its way up a steep slope in the jungle, while above this natural landscape, which shatters the weak and the strong with equal ferocity, soars the voice of Caruso, silencing all the pain and all the voices of the primeval forest and drowning out all birdsong. To be more precise: bird cries, for in this setting, left unfinished and abandoned by God in wrath, the birds do not sing; they shriek in pain, and confused trees tangle with one another like battling Titans, from horizon to horizon, in a steaming creation still being formed. Fog-panting and exhausted they stand in his unreal world, in unreal misery—and I, like a stanza in a poem written in an unknown foreign tongue, am shaken to the core.</p></div></blockquote><p></p></div></div><br></li><li>Watson, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Annotated-Illustrated-Double-Helix/dp/1476715491/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=The+Double+Helix&qid=1590853609&s=books&sr=1-3&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=320161b3e3c2ac06f954dc58ea2462dc&language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Double Helix</a><div class="collapsible"><a href="#collapsible-uuid-35" class="collapsebtn">Show Details <i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></a><div style="display:none" id="collapsible-uuid-35" class="collapsecontent"><p>A first-person view of the discovery of the structure of DNA.

But for some reason he is unable to write it, and instead begins to write down random thoughts: memories, comments on his family and colleagues, ideas about the Nazis, his work, and historiography in general. He also starts digging a tunnel in the basement.</p><p>Kohler is a miser, bitter, resentful, disappointed with life and the world, angry at everyone and everything - and this novel is a mainline into his mind. There is virtually no action or plot, no character development, and few ideas. It&#39;s challenging, but also remarkably funny. Robert Alter said it&#39;s a &quot;bloated monster&quot; that &quot;announces the end of moral history&quot;. What sets it apart is the verbal pyrotechnics, reminiscent of Ahab at his most extreme moments.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>I was certainly not the first youngster to be exiled for excellence, destined, without leaving home, to become a foreigner, an alien from the country of accomplishment. And I would not be the last to resent the attitudes which hemmed me in, and to loathe the ordinary in the world around me. I was simply blunter about my feelings than most. I had learned rather early how much the truth was disliked and distrusted, how much hearing it soured every state of the soul and injured every organ of the body: ear, head, heart (in that order), soon the belly, before descending to torment the bowel; so I spoke it—I held to it with more than customary dedication. Had the other virtues had such malicious consequences, I should have practiced them as energetically. (Now, of course, I lie as if the truth depended on it.) The common run detest me, I thought, so why shouldn’t I detest the common run? Yet here I am, the founder of the Party of the Disappointed People. We, in the PdP, with our tender and tormented, truth-beaten bodies: the common run will run out our bowels right enough. Later I would learn that sheer commonness was what we had in common, unlike the common preciousness of gems or the community of chlorophyll in leaves, but rather more like the commonness in unkindness or the common cold. I heard vulgarity in Wagner like one of his horns. Doctor Serafico was addicted to beating off. Even Fra Angelico’s supreme and saintly art served superstition. Imagine Maillart’s bridges soaring solely over sewers. That was, and remains, the situation. This commonness I speak of is nevertheless quite unusual. It is oddly shaped yet familiar in the way flatulence is familiar, or the barking of dogs, or the arrival of Friday, just as the anteater’s snout or the elephant’s trunk, ordinary to the elephant, average and everyday to the anteater, is astonishing, fascinating to us, ludicrous.</p><p>It would be an additional deception on my part to pretend that my high fidelities to honesty have helped me, because the fact is that they have seriously damaged my reputation as an historian, though I turned away from poetry in my youth because I thought the truth ill-treated there but welcome like another fallen temple among the ruins of the past. Admittedly, I was a fool. No one wants balance, truth, or fairness from history. No one. Everyone wants a consoling myth. And the consolation either takes the form of an assurance that X, whatever it was when, like every dog, it had its day, was singular, solitary, and unique, and that nothing like it could possibly happen again; or it imitates the pooh-pooh of condescension (Planmantee’s forte), insisting that things like X happen all the time, almost nonstop if you are so stupid as to have to be told. The first consolation is supported by a description of X which is so detailed and minute and grounded in local circumstances that it has no generality at all, and words despair of successfully narrating it; while the second depends upon a case put so abstractly (numerically, if Planmantee were to have his way) that a load of air would seem a gross heap beside it. It’s gone and done for, goodbye forever, the first says, we shall never again see its like, what a wonder; its return is inevitable, better duck, says the second. It’s water over the dam; it’s spilt milk: that’s Number One’s wisdom; there’s always more where that came from, is Number Two’s. The Germans were wicked in a one-time way, the Jews are a supremely special case, the Holocaust cannot occur again: that is what the First maintains. Holocausts have been happening since time first set up tock: that’s the Second’s assertion; and when Cain killed Abel, it was the equivalent of a holocaust, if you consider the percentage of the total population that one bad act subtracted. For the First, the Holocaust is a surd, and really ahistorical, as are all events if so minutely regarded. Any similarly examined condition is so extreme one cannot find a mean. Like a color which has no place in the continuum. Governali calls this point of view theological, while I prefer to think of it as esthetic; but Governali is always so eager to get to God, as if it were his stop on the train ride. Events are like perfect poems—matchless. For the Second, the Holocaust is perhaps an extreme example, the consummate pogrom, but only made major by improvements in technology. Besides, there’s always the Gulag to rival it. After all, forty million RIP’d during the Period in Question. Of course, the uniqueness of events cannot be described in language, perhaps they cannot even be experienced; whereas, if everything in history is some sort of repetition, then maybe only a ten-minute slice will satisfy our needs.</p></div></blockquote></div></div><br></li><li>Houellebecq<ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Whatever-Michel-Houellebecq/dp/1846687845/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=Whatever&qid=1590862130&s=books&sr=1-5&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=97768c19e6c1472123b13ae7cc2b8c5b&language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whatever</a><div class="collapsible"><a href="#collapsible-uuid-55" class="collapsebtn">Show Details <i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></a><div style="display:none" id="collapsible-uuid-55" class="collapsecontent"><p>Sexuality and the sexual marketplace in the 20th century.

It starts out as a detective story, switches to science-fiction, then goes off into the supernatural, and is full of the most detailed information of dozens of ghastly boring subjects. And the time sequence is all out of order in a very pretentious imitation of Faulkner and Joyce. Worst yet, it has the most raunchy sex scenes, thrown in just to make it sell, I&#39;m sure, and the authors - whom I&#39;ve never heard of - have the supreme bad taste to introduce real political figures into this mishmash and pretend to be exposing a real conspiracy.&#39;</p></div></blockquote><p></p></div></div><br></li><li>Tolstoy, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cossacks-Other-Stories-Penguin-Classics/dp/0140449590/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=Hadji+Murat&qid=1590877125&sr=8-2&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=dba22d66fa113a7a609640ca2422123a&language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hadji Murat</a><div class="collapsible"><a href="#collapsible-uuid-68" class="collapsebtn">Show Details <i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></a><div style="display:none" id="collapsible-uuid-68" class="collapsecontent"><p>Tolstoy once said to Maxim Gorky: &quot;without false modesty, <em>War and Peace</em> is like the <em>Iliad</em>.&quot; <em>Hadji Murat</em> is perhaps even more like the <em>Iliad</em>.
