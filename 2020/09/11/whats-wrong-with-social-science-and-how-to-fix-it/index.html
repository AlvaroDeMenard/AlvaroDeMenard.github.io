class="blockquotediv"><p>I&#39;ve seen things you people wouldn&#39;t believe.</p></div></blockquote><p>Over the past year, I have skimmed through 2578 social science papers, spending about 2.5 minutes on each one. This was due to my participation in <a href="https://www.replicationmarkets.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Replication Markets</a>, a part of DARPA&#39;s SCORE program, whose goal is to evaluate the reliability of social science research. 3000 studies were split up into 10 rounds of ~300 studies each. Starting in August 2019, each round consisted of one week of surveys followed by two weeks of market trading. I finished in first place in 3 out 10 survey rounds and 6 out of 10 market rounds. In total, about $200,000 in prize money will be awarded.</p><p>The studies were sourced from all social science disciplines (economics, psychology, sociology, management, etc.) and were published between 2009 and 2018 (in other words, most of the sample came from the post-replication crisis era).</p><p>The average replication probability in the market was 54%; while the replication results are not out yet (250 of the 3000 papers will be replicated), previous experiments have shown that prediction markets work well.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn14959634591" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref14959634591">1</sup></a></span></p><p>This is what the distribution of my own predictions looks like:<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn14959634592" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref14959634592">2</sup></a></span></p><img src="/images/skimmed_mypredsdist-fa92eb552a37c9781388ea80d6248534.png"><p>My average forecast was in line with the market. A quarter of the claims were above 76%. And a quarter of them were below 33%: we&#39;re talking hundreds upon hundreds of terrible papers, and this is just a tiny sample of the annual academic production.</p><p>Criticizing bad science from an abstract, 10000-foot view is pleasant: you hear about some stuff that doesn&#39;t replicate, some methodologies that seem a bit silly. &quot;They should improve their methods&quot;, &quot;p-hacking is bad&quot;, &quot;we must change the incentives&quot;, you declare Zeuslike from your throne in the clouds, and then go on with your day.</p><p>But actually diving into the sea of trash that is social science gives you a more tangible perspective, a more visceral revulsion, and perhaps even a sense of Lovecraftian awe at the sheer magnitude of it all: a vast landfill—a great agglomeration of garbage extending as far as the eye can see, effluvious waves crashing and throwing up a foul foam of p=0.049 papers. As you walk up to the diving platform, the deformed attendant hands you a pair of flippers. Noticing your reticence, he gives a subtle nod as if to say: &quot;come on then, jump in&quot;.</p><h2 id="They-Know-What-They-39-re-Doing"><a href="#They-Know-What-They-39-re-Doing" class="headerlink" title="They Know What They&#39;re Doing"></a>They Know What They&#39;re Doing</h2><p>Prediction markets work well because predicting replication is easy.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn14959634593" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref14959634593">3</sup></a></span> There&#39;s no need for a deep dive into the statistical methodology or a rigorous examination of the data, no need to scrutinize esoteric theories for subtle errors—these papers have obvious, surface-level problems.</p><p>There&#39;s a popular belief that weak studies are the result of unconscious biases leading researchers down a &quot;garden of forking paths&quot;. Given enough &quot;researcher degrees of freedom&quot; even the most punctilious investigator can be misled.</p><p>I find this belief impossible to accept. The brain is a credulous piece of meat<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn14959634594" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref14959634594">4</sup></a></span> but there are limits to self-delusion. Most of them have to know. It&#39;s understandable to be led down the garden of forking paths while producing the research, but when the paper is done and you give it a final read-over you will surely notice that all you have is a n=23, p=0.049 three-way interaction effect (one of dozens you tested, and with no multiple testing adjustments of course). At that point it takes more than a <em>subtle unconscious bias</em> to believe you have found something real. And even if the authors really are misled by the forking paths, what are the editors and reviewers doing? Are we supposed to believe they are all gullible rubes?</p><p>People within the academy don&#39;t want to rock the boat. They still have to attend the conferences, secure the grants, publish in the journals, show up at the faculty meetings: all these things depend on their peers. When criticising bad research it&#39;s easier for everyone to blame the forking paths rather than the person walking them. No need for uncomfortable unpleasantries. The fraudster can admit, without much of a hit to their reputation, that indeed they were <em>misled</em> by that <em>dastardly garden</em>, really through no fault of their own whatsoever, at which point their colleagues on twitter will applaud and say &quot;ah, good on you, you handled this tough situation with such exquisite virtue, this is how progress happens! hip, hip, hurrah!&quot; What a ridiculous charade.</p><p>Even when they do accuse someone of wrongdoing they use terms like &quot;Questionable Research Practices&quot; (QRP). How about Questionable Euphemism Practices?</p><ul><li>When they measure a dozen things and only pick their outcome variable at the end, that&#39;s not the garden of forking paths but the greenhouse of fraud.</li><li>When they do a correlational analysis but give &quot;policy implications&quot; as if they were doing a causal one, they&#39;re not walking around the garden, they&#39;re doing the landscaping of forking paths.</li><li>When they take a continuous variable and arbitrarily bin it to do subgroup analysis or when they add an <em>ad hoc</em> quadratic term to their regression, they&#39;re...fertilizing the garden of forking paths? (Look, there&#39;s only so many horticultural metaphors, ok?)</li></ul><p>The bottom line is this: if a random schmuck with zero domain expertise like me can predict what will replicate, <em>then so can scientists who have spent half their lives studying this stuff</em>. But they sure don&#39;t act like it.</p><h2 id="or-Maybe-They-Don-39-t"><a href="#or-Maybe-They-Don-39-t" class="headerlink" title="...or Maybe They Don&#39;t?"></a>...or Maybe They Don&#39;t?</h2><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>The horror! The horror!</p></div></blockquote><p>Check out this crazy chart from <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/04/28/1909046117" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yang et al. (2020)</a>:</p><img src="/images/skimmed_citations-d86cecc680152c2bca2edf372a1397ea.png"><p>Yes, you&#39;re reading that right: studies that replicate are cited at the same rate as studies that do not. Publishing your own weak papers is one thing, but citing other people&#39;s weak papers? This seemed implausible, so I decided to do my own analysis with a sample of 250 articles from the Replication Markets project. The correlation between citations per year and (market-estimated) probability of replication was -0.05!</p><p>You might hypothesize that the citations of non-replicating papers are negative, but negative citations are extremely rare.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn14959634595" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref14959634595">5</sup></a></span> <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/112/45/13823" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One study</a> puts the rate at 2.4%. Astonishingly, even <em>after retraction</em> the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18974415/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vast majority of citations are positive</a>, and those positive citations <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20136577/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continue for decades after retraction</a>.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn14959634596" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref14959634596">6</sup></a></span></p><p>As in all affairs of man, it once again comes down to Hanlon&#39;s Razor. Either:</p><ol><li>Malice: they know which results are likely false but cite them anyway.</li><li>or, Stupidity: they can&#39;t tell which papers will replicate even though it&#39;s quite easy.</li></ol><p>Accepting the first option would require a level of cynicism that even I struggle to muster. But the alternative doesn&#39;t seem much better: <em>how can they not know?</em> I, an idiot with no relevant credentials or knowledge, can fairly accurately determine good research from bad, but all the tenured experts can not? How can they not tell <em>which papers are retracted</em>?</p><p>I think the most plausible explanation is that scientists don&#39;t read the papers they cite, which I suppose involves both malice <em>and</em> stupidity.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn14959634597" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref14959634597">7</sup></a></span> <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Scanners#citogenesis-how-often-do-researchers-not-read-the-papers-they-cite" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gwern has a nice write-up on this question</a> citing some ingenious analyses based on the proliferation of misprints: &quot;Simkin &amp; Roychowdhury venture a guess that as many as 80% of authors citing a paper have not actually read the original&quot;. Once a paper is out there nobody bothers to check it, even though they know there&#39;s a 50-50 chance it&#39;s false!</p><p>Whatever the explanation might be, the fact is that the academic system does not allocate citations to true claims.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn14959634598" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref14959634598">8</sup></a></span> This is bad not only for the direct effect of basing further research on false results, but also because it distorts the incentives scientists face. If nobody cited weak studies, we wouldn&#39;t have so many of them. Rewarding impact without regard for the truth inevitably leads to disaster.</p><h2 id="There-Are-No-Journals-With-Strict-Quality-Standards"><a href="#There-Are-No-Journals-With-Strict-Quality-Standards" class="headerlink" title="There Are No Journals With Strict Quality Standards"></a>There Are No Journals With Strict Quality Standards</h2><p>Naïvely you might expect that the top-ranking journals would be full of studies that are highly likely to replicate, and the low-ranking journals would be full of p&lt;0.1 studies based on five undergraduates. Not so! Like citations, journal status and quality are not very well correlated: <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2018.00037/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there is no association between statistical power and impact factor</a>, and journals with higher impact factor <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/071530v1.full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have more papers with erroneous p-values</a>.</p><p>This pattern is repeated in the Replication Markets data. As you can see in the chart below, there&#39;s no relationship between h-index (a measure of impact) and average expected replication rates. There&#39;s also no relationship between h-index and expected replication <em>within</em> fields.</p><img src="/images/skimmed_journalhindex-ca7f13c9c49418c27360860f1eea7c81.png"><p>Even the <em>crème de la crème</em> of economics journals barely manage a ⅔ expected replication rate. 1 in 5 articles in QJE scores below 50%, and this is a journal that accepts just 1 out of every 30 submissions. Perhaps this (partially) explains why scientists are undiscerning: journal reputation acts as a cloak for bad research. It would be fun to test this idea empirically.</p><p>Here you can see the distribution of replication estimates for every journal in the RM sample:</p><img src="/images/skimmed_journals-f921b235abcb4112f33768db0de23c32.png"><p>As far as I can tell, for most journals the question of whether the results in a paper are true is a matter of secondary importance. If we model journals as wanting to maximize &quot;impact&quot;, then this is hardly surprising: as we saw above, citation counts are unrelated to truth. If scientists were more careful about what they cited, then journals would in turn be more careful about what they publish.</p><h2 id="Things-Are-Not-Getting-Better"><a href="#Things-Are-Not-Getting-Better" class="headerlink" title="Things Are Not Getting Better"></a>Things Are Not Getting Better</h2><p>Before we got to see any of the actual Replication Markets studies, we voted on the expected replication rates by year. <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.200566" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gordon et al. (2020)</a> has that data: replication rates were expected to steadily increase from 43% in 2009/2010 to 55% in 2017/2018.</p><img src="/images/skimmed_years_pre-69784abd305d467911cc993619ce2a06.png"><p>This is what the average predictions looked like <em>after</em> seeing the papers: from 53.4% in 2009 to 55.8% in 2018 (difference not statistically significant; black dots are means).</p><img src="/images/skimmed_years-b99c160aafc17e0fb420f4e54059cfb6.png"><p>I frequently encounter the notion that after the replication crisis hit there was some sort of great improvement in the social sciences, that people wouldn&#39;t even dream of publishing studies based on 23 undergraduates any more (I actually saw plenty of those), etc. Stuart Ritchie&#39;s new book praises psychologists for developing &quot;systematic ways to address&quot; the flaws in their discipline. In reality there has been no discernible improvement.</p><p>The results aren&#39;t out yet, so it&#39;s possible that the studies have improved in subtle ways which the forecasters have not been able to detect. Perhaps the actual replication rates will be higher. But I doubt it. Looking at the distribution of p-values over time, there&#39;s a small increase in the proportion of p&lt;.001 results, but nothing like the huge improvement that was expected.</p><img src="/images/skimmed_yearlypvals-a412e367fe00884f5d5ae5241669de66.png"><h2 id="Everyone-is-Complicit"><a href="#Everyone-is-Complicit" class="headerlink" title="Everyone is Complicit"></a>Everyone is Complicit</h2><p>Authors are just one small cog in the vast machine of scientific production. For this stuff to be financed, generated, published, and eventually rewarded requires the complicity of funding agencies, journal editors, peer reviewers, and hiring/tenure committees. Given the current structure of the machine, ultimately the funding agencies are to blame.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn14959634599" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref14959634599">9</sup></a></span> But &quot;I was just following the incentives&quot; only goes so far. <strong>Editors and reviewers don&#39;t actually need to accept these blatantly bad papers.</strong></p><p>Journals and universities certainly can&#39;t blame the incentives when they stand behind fraudsters to the <em>bitter end</em>. Paolo Macchiarini &quot;<a href="https://leapsmag.com/a-star-surgeon-left-a-trail-of-dead-patients-and-his-whistleblowers-were-punished/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left a trail of dead patients</a>&quot; but was protected for years by his university. Andrew Wakefield&#39;s famously fraudulent autism-MMR study took <em>12 years</em> to retract. Even when the author of a paper admits the results were entirely based on an error, <a href="https://elemental.medium.com/when-science-needs-self-correcting-a130eacb4235" target="_blank" rel="noopener">journals still won&#39;t retract</a>.</p><p><a href="https://scienceintegritydigest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elisabeth Bik documents her attempts to report fraud to journals</a>. It looks like this:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>The Editor in Chief of Neuroscience Letters [Yale&#39;s Stephen G. Waxman] never replied to my email. The APJTM journal had a new publisher, so I wrote to both current Editors in Chief, but they never replied to my email.</p></div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Two papers from this set had been published in Wiley journals, Gerodontology and J Periodontology.

Suppose you are a social scientist, and you notice that wet pavements tend to be related to umbrella usage. You do a little study and find the correlation is bulletproof. You publish the paper and try to sneak in some causal language when the editors/reviewers aren&#39;t paying attention. Rain is never even mentioned. Of course if someone repeats your study, they will get a significant result every time. This may sound absurd, but it describes a large proportion of the papers that <em>successfully replicate</em>.</p><p>Economists and education researchers tend to be relatively good with this stuff, but as far as I can tell most social scientists go through 4 years of undergrad and 4-6 years of PhD studies without ever encountering ideas like &quot;identification strategy&quot;, &quot;model misspecification&quot;, &quot;omitted variable&quot;, &quot;reverse causality&quot;, or &quot;third-cause&quot;. Or maybe they know and deliberately publish crap. Fields like nutrition and epidemiology are in an even worse state, but let&#39;s not get into that right now.</p><p>&quot;But Alvaro, correlational studies can be usef-&quot; <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Causality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spare me</a>.</p><p>Second: the <strong>choice of claim for replication</strong>. For some papers it&#39;s clear (eg math educational intervention → math scores), but other papers make dozens of different claims which are all equally important. Sometimes the Replication Markets organisers picked an uncontroversial claim from a paper whose central experiment was actually highly questionable. In this way a study can get the &quot;successfully replicates&quot; label without its most contentious claim being tested.</p><p>Third: <strong>effect size</strong>. Should we interpret claims in social science as being about the magnitude of an effect, or only about its direction? If the original study says an intervention raises math scores by .5 standard deviations and the replication finds that the effect is .2 standard deviations (though still significant), that is considered a success that vindicates the original study! This is one area in which we absolutely have to abandon the binary replicates/doesn&#39;t replicate approach and start thinking more like Bayesians.</p><p>Fourth: <strong>external validity</strong>. A replicated lab experiment is still a lab experiment. While some replications try to address aspects of external validity (such as generalizability across different cultures), the question of whether these effects are relevant in the real world is generally not addressed.</p><p>Fifth: <strong>triviality</strong>. A lot of the papers in the 85%+ chance-to-replicate range are just really obvious. &quot;Homeless students have lower test scores&quot;, &quot;parent wealth predicts their children&#39;s wealth&quot;, that sort of thing. These are not worthless, but they&#39;re also not really expanding the frontiers of science.</p><p>So: while about half the papers will replicate, I would estimate that only half <em>of those</em> are actually worthwhile.</p><h2 id="Lack-of-Theory"><a href="#Lack-of-Theory" class="headerlink" title="Lack of Theory"></a>Lack of Theory</h2><p>The majority of journal articles are almost completely atheoretical. Even if all the statistical, p-hacking, publication bias, etc. issues were fixed, we&#39;d still be left with a ton of ad-hoc hypotheses based, at best, on (WEIRD) folk intuitions. But how can science advance if there&#39;s no theoretical grounding, nothing that can be refuted or refined? A pile of &quot;facts&quot; does not a progressive scientific field make.</p><p>Michael Muthukrishna and the superhuman Joe Henrich have written a paper called <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0522-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Problem in Theory</a> which covers the issue better than I ever could.

What does &quot;false positive&quot; even mean if there are no &quot;fake&quot; effects, unless it refers purely to the direction of the effect?

There are certainly large improvements to be made—a 2/3 replication rate is not something to be proud of. But reading their papers you get the sense that <em>at least they&#39;re trying</em>, which is more than can be said of some other fields. 6 of the top 10 economics journals participated, and they did quite well: QJE is the behemoth of the field and it managed to finish very close to the top. A unique weakness of economics is the frequent use of absurd instrumental variables. I doubt there&#39;s anyone (including the authors) who is convinced by that stuff, so let&#39;s cut it out.</p><p><strong>EvoPsych is Surprisingly Bad</strong></p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>You were supposed to destroy the Sith, not join them!</p></div></blockquote><p>Going into this, my view of evolutionary psychology was shaped by people like Cosmides, Tooby, DeVore, Boehm, and so on. You know, <em>evolutionary psychology</em>! But the studies I skimmed from evopsych journals were mostly just weak social psychology papers with an infinitesimally thin layer of evolutionary paint on top. Few people seem to take the &quot;evolutionary&quot; aspect really seriously.</p><p>Also underdetermination problems are particularly difficult in this field and nobody seems to care.</p><p><strong>Education is Surprisingly Good</strong></p><p>Education was expected to be the worst field, but it ended up being almost as strong as economics. When it came to interventions there were lots of RCTs with fairly large samples, which made their claims believable. I also got the sense that p-hacking is more difficult in education: there&#39;s usually only one math score which measures the impact of a math intervention, there&#39;s no early stopping, etc.</p><p>However, many of the top-scoring papers were trivial (eg &quot;there are race differences in science scores&quot;), and the field has a unique problem which is not addressed by replication: educational intervention effects are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5779101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notorious for fading out after a few years</a>. If the replications waited 5 years to follow up on the students, things would look much, much worse.</p><p><strong>Demography is Good</strong></p><p>Who even knew these people existed? Yet it seems they do (relatively) competent work. <em>googles some of the authors</em> Ah, they&#39;re economists. Well.</p><p><strong>Criminology Should Just Be Scrapped</strong></p><p>If you thought social psychology was bad, you ain&#39;t seen nothin&#39; yet. Other fields have a mix of good and bad papers, but criminology is a shocking outlier. Almost every single paper I read was awful. Even among the papers that are highly likely to replicate, it&#39;s <em>de rigueur</em> to confuse correlation for causation.</p><p>If we compare criminology to, say, education, the headline replication rates look similar-ish. But the designs used in education (typically RCT, diff-in-diff, or regression discontinuity) are at least <em>in principle</em> capable of detecting the effects they&#39;re looking for. That&#39;s not really the case for criminology. Perhaps this is an effect of the (small number of) specific journals selected for RM, and there is more rigorous work published elsewhere.</p><p>There&#39;s no doubt in my mind that the net effect of criminology as a discipline is negative: to the extent that public policy is guided by these people, it is worse. Just shameful.</p><p><strong>Marketing/Management</strong></p><p>In their current state these are a bit of a joke, but I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything fundamentally wrong with them. Sure, some of the variables they use are a bit fluffy, and of course there&#39;s a lack of theory. But the things they study are a good fit for RCTs, and if they just quintupled their sample sizes they would see massive improvements.</p><p><strong>Cognitive Psychology</strong></p><p>Much worse than expected; generally has a reputation as being one of the more solid subdisciplines of psychology, and has done well in previous replication projects.

If you click those links you will find a ton of papers on metascientific issues. But there seems to be a gap between awareness of the problem and implementing policy to fix it. You&#39;ve got tons of people doing all this research and trying to repair the broken scientific process, while at the same time journal editors won&#39;t even retract blatantly fraudulent research.</p><p>There is even a history of government involvement. In the 70s there were battles in Congress over questionable NSF grants, and in the 80s Congress (led by Al Gore) was concerned about scientific integrity, which eventually led to the establishment of the Office of Scientific Integrity. (It then took the federal government another 11 years to come up with a decent definition of scientific misconduct.) After a couple of <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg14019001-600-no-misconduct/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">embarrassing high-profile prosecutorial failures</a> they more or less gave up, but they still exist today and prosecute about a dozen people per year.</p><p>Generations of psychologists have come and gone and nothing has been done. The only difference is that today we have a better sense of the scale of the problem. The one ray of hope is that at least we have started doing a few replications, but I don&#39;t see that fundamentally changing things: replications reveal false positives, but they do nothing to prevent those false positives from being published in the first place.</p><h2 id="What-To-Do"><a href="#What-To-Do" class="headerlink" title="What To Do"></a>What To Do</h2><p>The reason nothing has been done since the 50s, despite everyone knowing about the problems, is simple: bad incentives. The best cases for government intervention are collective action problems: situations where the incentives for each actor cause suboptimal outcomes for the group as a whole, and it&#39;s difficult to coordinate bottom-up solutions. In this case the negative effects are not confined to academia, but overflow to society as a whole when these false results are used to inform business and policy.</p><p>Nobody actually benefits from the present state of affairs, but you can&#39;t ask isolated individuals to sacrifice their careers for the &quot;greater good&quot;: the only viable solutions are top-down, which means either the granting agencies or Congress (or, <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/03/03/reactionary-philosophy-in-an-enormous-planet-sized-nutshell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as Scott Alexander has suggested</a>, a Science Czar). You need a power that sits above the system and has its own incentives in order: this approach has already had success with <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0132382.g001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requirements for pre-registration and publication of clinical trials</a>. Right now I believe the most valuable activity in metascience is not replication or open science initiatives but <em>political lobbying</em>.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn149596345919" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref149596345919">19</sup></a></span></p><ul><li><strong>Earmark 60% of funding for registered reports</strong> (ie accepted for publication based on the preregistered design only, not results).

Including metascientific research that can be used to develop a serious science policy in the future.</li><li><strong>Increase sample sizes and lower the significance threshold to .005</strong>. This one needs to be targeted: studies of small effects probably need to quadruple their sample sizes in order to get their power to reasonable levels. The median study would only need 2x or so. Lowering alpha is generally preferable to increasing power. &quot;But Alvaro, doesn&#39;t that mean that fewer grants would be funded?&quot; Yes.</li><li><strong>Ignore citation counts.</strong> Given that citations are unrelated to (easily-predictable) replicability, let alone any subtler quality aspects, their use as an evaluative tool should stop immediately.</li><li><strong>Open data</strong>, enforced by the NSF/NIH.

Beware Goodhart&#39;s law!</li><li>Why not <strong>do away with the journal system altogether</strong>? The NSF could run its own centralized, open website; grants would require publication there. Journals are objectively not doing their job as gatekeepers of quality or truth, so what even is a journal? A combination of taxonomy and reputation. The former is better solved by a simple tag system, and the latter is actually misleading. Peer review is unpaid work anyway, it could continue as is. Attach a replication prediction market (with the estimated probability displayed in gargantuan neon-red font right next to the paper title) and you&#39;re golden. Without the crutch of &quot;high ranked journals&quot; maybe we could move to better ways of evaluating scientific output. No more editors refusing to publish replications. You can&#39;t shift the incentives: academics want to publish in &quot;high-impact&quot; journals, and journals want to selectively publish &quot;high-impact&quot; research. So just make it impossible. Plus as a bonus side-effect this would finally sink Elsevier.</li><li>Have <strong>authors bet on replication of their research</strong>. Give them fixed odds, say 1:4—if it&#39;s good work, it&#39;s +EV for them. This sounds a bit distasteful, so we could structure the same cashflows as a &quot;bonus grant&quot; from the NSF when a paper you wrote replicates successfully.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn149596345922" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref149596345922">22</sup></a></span></li></ul><p>And a couple of points that individuals can implement today:</p><ul><li><strong>Just stop citing bad research</strong>, I shouldn&#39;t need to tell you this, jesus christ what the fuck is wrong with you people.</li><li><strong>Read the papers you cite.</strong> Or at least make your grad students to do it for you.

We&#39;re talking about an organization with an 8 billion dollar budget that is responsible for a huge part of social science funding, and they can&#39;t manage to inform people that their grant was declined! These are the people we must depend on to fix everything.</p><p>When it comes to giant bureaucracies it can be difficult to know where (if anywhere) the actual power lies. But a good start would be at the top: NSF director Sethuraman Panchanathan, SES division director Daniel L. Goroff, NIH director Francis S. Collins, and the members of the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/nsb/members/index.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Science Board</a>. The broken incentives of the academy did not appear out of nowhere, they are the result of grant agency policies.

Add some dredging and HARKing to that and you can squeeze a result out of anything.
