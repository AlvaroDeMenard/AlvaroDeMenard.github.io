A lovely collection of 7 picaresque novellas that revolve around Maqroll, a cosmopolitan vagabond of the seas. Stylistically rich and sumptuous. It&#39;s set in a kind of parallel maritime world, the world of traders and seamen and port city whores. Very melancholy, with doomed business ventures at the edge of civilization, doomed loves, doomed lives, and so on. While the reader takes vicarious pleasure in the &quot;nomadic mania&quot; of Maqroll, the underlying feeling is one of fundamental dissatisfaction with what life has to offer—ultimately the book is about our attempts to overcome it. Reminiscent of Conrad, but also Herzog&#39;s diaries plus a bit of Borges in the style.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pandoras-Box-History-First-World/dp/067424480X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=&linkCode=ll1&tag=fanachronism-21&linkId=62198cd52b14cc63bc00bed622931003&language=en_GB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pandora’s Box: A History of the First World War</a></strong> by Jörn Leonhard. A comprehensive, single-volume history of WWI from a German author. It goes far beyond military history: besides the battles and armaments it covers geopolitics and diplomacy, national politics, economics, public opinion, morale. All fronts and combatants are explored, and all this squeezed into just 900 pages (some things are inevitably left out - for example no mention is made of <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/03/17/book-review-hoover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hoover&#39;s famine relief efforts</a>). Its approach is rather abstract, so if you&#39;re looking for a visceral description of the trenches this isn&#39;t the book for you. The translation isn&#39;t great, and it can get a bit dry and repetitive, but overall it&#39;s a very impressive tome. n.b. the hardcover edition from HUP is astonishingly bad and started falling apart immediately.

A concise work on the ethical dilemmas posed by genetic enhancement technology.

Despite its short length, it goes into remarkable practical detail on things like how oxytocin affects behavior, the causes of global wealth inequality, and the potential of genetic editing to decrease the demand for plastic surgery.

I admire its ethos, and it&#39;s sometimes <em>very</em> funny. But ironic shitposting is still shitposting, and 700 pages of shitposting is a bit...pleonastic. At one point the narrator explains his digressions in the form of a line, one for each volume:</p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/ssrc-static/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/14144311/Sherwood-1-e1510688607696-684x1024.jpg"></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Illuminations-Essays-Reflections-Walter-Benjamin/dp/1328470237/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=Illuminations&qid=1607806328&sr=8-2&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=c995f2145358a20a2e227ba3f599ed0c&language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Illuminations</a></strong> by Walter Benjamin. Doesn&#39;t really live up to the hype. The essays on Proust and Baudelaire are fine, the hagiography of Brecht feels extremely silly in retrospect. The myopia of extremist 1930s politics prevents him from seeing very far.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Omensetters-Luck-Classic-20th-Century-Penguin/dp/0141180102/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=Omensetter's+Luck&qid=1607995376&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=6d947c729aabeeb56da28d1dee1157d4&language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Omensetter&#39;s Luck</a></strong> by William Gass. An experimental novel that does a great job of evoking 19th century rural America. Omensetter is a beguiling, larger-than-life figure, a kind of natural animal of a man. Nowhere near as good as <em>The Tunnel</em> and not much easier to read either. It&#39;s clearly an early piece, before Gass had fully developed his style.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href>The Silence: A Novel</a></strong> by Don DeLillo. Not so much a novel as a sketch of one. Not even undercooked, completely raw. It&#39;s about a sudden shutdown of all technology. Stylistically uninteresting compared to his other work. <a href="https://biblioklept.org/2020/10/22/don-delillos-new-book-the-silence-is-a-slim-disappointment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here&#39;s a good review</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Little Science, Big Science</strong> by Derek John de Solla Price. Purports to be about the science of science, but really mostly an exploration of descriptive statistics over time - number of scientists, the distribution of their productivity and intelligence, distribution across countries, citations, and so on. Should have been a blog post. Nice charts, worth skimming just for them. (Very much out of print, but you can grab a <a href="https://archive.org/details/littlesciencebig0000pric" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pdf from the internet archive</a> or libgen).</p></li><li><p><strong>Experiment and the Making of Meaning: Human Agency in Scientific Observation and Experiment</strong> by David Gooding. Skimmed it. Written in 1990 but feels very outdated, nobody cares about observation sentences any more and they didn&#39;t in 1990 either. Some interesting points about the importance of experiment (as opposed to theory) in scientific progress. On the other hand all the fluffy stuff about &quot;meaning&quot; left me completely cold.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Subjective Side of Science: A Philosophical Inquiry into the Psychology of the Apollo Moon Scientists</strong> by Ian Mitroff. Based on a series of structured interviews with geologists working on the Apollo project. Remarkably raw. Mitroff argues in favor of the subjective side, the biased side, of how scientists actually perform science in the real world. On personality types, relations between scientists, etc. There are some silly parts, like an attempt to tie Jungian psychology with the psychological clusters in science, and a very strange typology of scientific approaches toward the end, but overall it&#39;s above-average for the genre.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Memoir-Craft-Stephen-King-ebook/dp/B000FC0SIM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=On+Writing:+A+Memoir+of+the+Craft&qid=1608402528&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=d8e0b44e4ff3d42379f4e964ff4897f5&language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft</a></strong> by Stephen King. A pleasant autobiography combined with some tips on writing. The two parts don&#39;t really fit together very well. This was my first King book, I imagine it&#39;s much better if you&#39;re a fan (he talks about his own novels quite a lot).</p></li><li><p><strong><a href>The Lord Chandos Letter And Other Writings</a></strong> by Hugo von Hofmannsthal. A collection of short stories plus the titular essay. If David Lynch had been a symbolist writer, these are the kinds of stories he would have produced. Vague, mystical, dreamlike, impressionistic. I found them unsatisfying, and they never captured my interest enough to try to disentangle the symbols and allegories. The final essay about the limitations of language is worth reading, however.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ghost-Soldiers-Forgotten-Dramatic-Mission/dp/0375431101/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=Ghost+Soldiers:+The+Forgotten+Epic+Story+of+World+War+II's+Most+Dramatic+Mission&qid=1607806481&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=a76da0c6bba1ce57bcbe2bc88d2b1fe5&language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ghost Soldiers: The Forgotten Epic Story of World War II&#39;s Most Dramatic Mission</a></strong> by Hampton Sides. An account of a daring mission to rescue POWs held by the Japanese in the Philippines. The mission itself is fascinating but fairly short, and the book is padded with a lot of background info that is nowhere near as interesting (though it does set the scene). Parts of it are brutal and revolting beyond belief.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/We-Are-Legion-We-Are-Bob-audiobook/dp/B01L082SCI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=We+Are+Legion+(We+Are+Bob)&qid=1608402622&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=09c6ea26680b8a9481bab6cb52604520&language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">We Are Legion (We Are Bob)</a></strong> by Dennis Taylor. An interesting premise: a story told from the perspective of a sentient von Neumann probe. That premise is sort-of squandered by a juvenile approach filled to the brim with plot holes, and an inconclusive story arc: it&#39;s just setting up the sequels. Still, it&#39;s pretty entertaining. If you want a goofy space opera audiobook to listen to while doing other stuff, I&#39;d recommend it.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rocket-Men-Odyssey-Astronauts-Journey/dp/0812988701/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=3f04c65736d2c1e4c79f84d0d8d04193&language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rocket Men: The Daring Odyssey of Apollo 8 and the Astronauts Who Made Man&#39;s First Journey to the Moon</a></strong> by Robert Kurson. Focused on the personalities, personal lives, and families of the three astronauts on Apollo 8: Frank Borman, William Anders, and James Lovell, set against the tumultuous political situation of late 1960s America. Written in a cinematic style, there&#39;s little on the technical/organizational aspects of Apollo 8. Its treatment of the cold war is rather naïve. The book achieves its goals, but I was looking for something different. Ray Porter (who I usually like) screws up the narration of the audiobook with an over-emotive approach, often emphasizing the wrong words. Really strange.</p><div class="subscribediv" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:250px;margin-top:30px"><form class="validate"
