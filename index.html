Augustine</strong></p></div></blockquote><p>In 1863, William Lang ran a mile in 4 minutes and 2 seconds, a record that would endure for 80 years. Standing undefeated across the decades, across two world wars, from horse and cart to television and airplanes, the record attained a mythical status. After innumerable failed attempts at breaking it, the 4 minute mile was considered impossible. Experts claimed the human heart would explode from the strain.</p><p>In 1954, Roger Bannister did what doctors had declared <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/7404?seq=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">physically impossible</a>: he ran a mile in under 4 minutes. A few weeks later the record was crushed again, and then another 46 times within just three years.</p><p>The essay you are reading right now is the four minute mile of Fucking.</p><h3 id="Monk-Life"><a href="#Monk-Life" class="headerlink" title="Monk Life"></a>Monk Life</h3><p>Starting in my 20s, I spent about 15 years being celibate. Not because I couldn&#39;t get laid, I just chose not to. I was more interested in reading books than chasing women. A mediocre relationship as a teenager, feeling like I had to change who I was in order to get women (and turn into something I didn&#39;t like), feeling like I was undesirable, and generally just being more interested in learning at this time led me down that path. Then one day, at 34, I got bored and suddenly decided to make Fucking my autistic special interest. Soon, I was juggling relationships with multiple women and turning down eager propositions because I had better things to do.</p><p>Of course, I had to leave some things behind. I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TelElTAONQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">betrayed the philosophical life</a>. Didn&#39;t read very much, and certainly didn&#39;t write anything. The mind atrophies as more and more blood is dedicated to engorging the penis, starving the brain of its essential nutrients and withering away its noumenal capacities.</p><p>This isn&#39;t a pickup guide. It&#39;s the story of a self-experiment. It&#39;s a case study in arbitrary limitations and choosing one&#39;s character. It&#39;s about social scripts. And it&#39;s about the discovery that what many consider to be rare and precious is actually abundant and easily accessible, if only you choose to pursue it.</p><p>People convince themselves of the absurd nonsense like &quot;I&#39;m just not good with women&quot;, &quot;I&#39;m too old to start dating seriously&quot;, &quot;I&#39;m not attractive enough for casual sex&quot;. These are nothing more than meaningless fixed ideas, and you can just wake up one day and decide to follow a different one.</p><p>Before we go further, let&#39;s establish that I&#39;m not some gigachad by nature. I&#39;m in my late 30s, tall and lean, not particularly handsome, and with the kind of light balding that says &quot;I read too much philosophy&quot;. I&#39;m a pretty good baker, I have a decent job that nobody is impressed by or interested in, and in the end I&#39;m fundamentally a weird nerd writing esoteric blog posts on the internet.</p><h3 id="What-39-s-a-Vagina"><a href="#What-39-s-a-Vagina" class="headerlink" title="What&#39;s a Vagina?"></a>What&#39;s a Vagina?</h3><p>So what is it like to be a manwhore? Pretty sweet, actually. (If you were wondering why I haven&#39;t written a real essay in 2 years, now you know.) But it didn&#39;t start out that way...</p><p>My approach to trying new things is to dive into the deep end of the pool and figure out if I can swim. So, naturally, the first thing I did was to buy some leather handcuffs and a wand vibrator. I took a few decent pics, created a tinder profile, and started swiping.</p><p>My first date a few days later was a cute 21 year-old Ukrainian girl. We had a quick chat on the app and I invited her out for a drink. We met up outside the metro, walked to a bar and had a pleasantly anodyne chat for about an hour or so. I did not touch her beyond an initial hug. At that point I asked her if she wanted to come back to my place; she was up to it, and we headed off. On the walk back I thought to myself: &quot;what the hell are all those people on the internet talking about? Dating is the easiest thing in the world&quot;.</p><p>She asked me about my sexual experience, especially with BDSM, but I was too insecure to tell her the truth, so I bullshitted about how some ex introduced me to the idea a couple of years ago.</p><p>We got back to my place and started making out on the couch a bit. It was at this point that ambition and reality came crashing into each other. I suddenly realized that I did not remember how any of this worked. I was basically a virgin all over again. I took her into the bedroom, but everything was <em>off</em>. I was too nervous, too eager, moving too fast. Neither of us was comfortable. I could barely get hard. Neither of us came. A disaster on every level.</p><p>I walked her down to the tram stop and never contacted her again. The embarrassment was just too bad.</p><p>The second time around was...not much better. And the third one too. Let me quote some of my dating notes from this time:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>It is probably too early to judge after 4 dating partners, but thus far the apps have brought me nothing but disappointment, pain, and anxiety. I can&#39;t even get hard for the women I sleep with. I sincerely hope there is something better down the line because otherwise I am so fucked.</p></div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Initially thought I&#39;d just fuck around, but very quickly discovered I was not built for casual sex. Don&#39;t enjoy sex all that much to begin with tbh. Can barely cum from it, when I manage to get hard! (Later note: maybe this was a bit misguided? (Later later note: it was misguided.)) [note from significantly later: casual sex is good actually]</p></div></blockquote><p>But I kept trying, figuring out what to do and what not to do, getting feedback from my partners, experimenting with all sorts of new things, and just generally getting the hang of it. About a month after starting, I met someone I became madly infatuated with, fumbled it hard, and it was all over after just 4 dates. My notes are amusing in retrospect, so earnest:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Intrusive thoughts all the time, even when I&#39;m spending intimate time with other women [...] I&#39;m terrified of doing the wrong things, being too honest or not honest enough, coming on too strong or not strong enough. I&#39;m scared that by liking you too much I&#39;m going to start repulsing you: afraid of challenging you, acting like a doormat. Nobody wants a doormat.</p></div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Went from fucking being happy all on my own to the utter bullshit of limerence, loneliness, neediness...this shit better be worth it in the long run, man.</p></div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>What if in the end our relations are the only thing that really matters, and it&#39;s too late for me? What if I&#39;m totally fucked?</p></div></blockquote><p>That was my first inkling that I really wanted something more than just casual sex, but I also felt the need to explore more before trying to settle down.</p><p>I had grown up on a steady diet of third-hand dating wisdom: I needed to act like a douche, develop &quot;game,&quot; become some sort of Alpha Chad. Early on, dating felt like a rollercoaster partly because I was not really secure in myself. A week without any matches would feel depressing, a week with multiple dates would make me feel like I was on top of the world. Fundamentally the issue was that I was looking for external validation and trying to protect or build up a fragile ego. [not sure if this fits here]</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>So easy to get discouraged, even when things are going relatively well, I&#39;m banging multiple women, etc. One failure and I&#39;m feeling bad ffs.</p></div></blockquote><p>What took a while to figure out was that being a weirdo worked just fine. More than &quot;just fine&quot;, it was the right thing to do, because that&#39;s the only way you can attract people who are really into <em>you</em>. Breaking through the initial pain and anxiety was crucial though, I think it&#39;s easy to get caught in a cycle of low self-esteem, failing to improve, and self-sabotaging, which just causes more low self-esteem. But I just picked up the pieces, kept learning, and kept going. I tried to embrace rejection: fear of rejection is paralyzing, yet actual rejection gives clarity, courage, and finality. The absurd thing is that even after dozens of rejections, the fear never gets easier. The lesson seems impossible to internalize—maybe I needed more repetitions? Should&#39;ve done 5x5 rejections twice a week like some kind of twisted gym routine? [this par doesn&#39;t totally fit either?]</p><h3 id="The-Harem-of-an-Autist"><a href="#The-Harem-of-an-Autist" class="headerlink" title="The Harem of an Autist"></a>The Harem of an Autist</h3><p>Between August 2022 and June 2024 I went on 36 first dates with women of 26 different ethnicities. I slept with 17 of them, and had steady relationships with 7. From portfolio managers to women with shaved heads and dagger tattoos on their chest, I was mostly drawn to the &quot;art hoes&quot;.</p><img src="/images/arthoe-0cd6de985d7f386ec9ad7e3e5c969406.png" title="art hoe definition." alt="I don&apos;t play guitar or skate."><span class="image-caption">I don&apos;t play guitar or skate.</span><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It didn&#39;t take long for me to figure out what to do in bed. Six months after my first date, one of my friends with benefits used the words &quot;transcendent&quot; and &quot;I felt something die in me&quot; to describe our night together. But my brain was busy cataloguing her self-absorption and being bored.</p><p>A curious thing I noticed was that many of the women I dated weren&#39;t actually seeing other guys on the side. Some were uninterested, unwilling to put in the effort, while some (even really cute girls) seemed to have trouble finding even someone willing to bang them. So I found myself in a weird harem situation, dating 3-4 women at a time, having threesomes and generally living a life of debauchery. My calendar looked like a messy game of Tetris.</p><p>This is the timeline of all my dates/relationships (blue: had sex; red: no sex):</p><img src="/images/dating_gantt-511dcfb940249b3944a4f2272a490a6e.jpg" title="gantt chart" alt="Nothing says &apos;catch&apos; like a man who Gantt-charts his dating history."><span class="image-caption">Nothing says &apos;catch&apos; like a man who Gantt-charts his dating history.</span><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The reality of being a &quot;player&quot; was not always what I had imagined it to be though. Take Alice, for example: she was kind of a hopeless romantic who had spent a decade pining over her ex. Three dates in, she was clearly falling for me harder than I was for her. She was lovely: beautiful, intelligent, great in bed, had her shit together. She wrote me poems. We even lived together for a couple of months. And yet for some reason beyond my understanding, I felt an emotional distance that could not be overcome. I think on some subconscious level I was getting off on making her fall for me even more, but the screwed up power dynamic just gave me a hollow feeling. I almost stopped reading during my relationship with her, and my creativity died completelyal. I realized that I needed something different out of my partner, something with more intensity, even if it means having to go through more turbulence. Alice thought we&#39;d date for a year and amicably go our separate ways, and that&#39;s what happened in the end.</p><p>Having women compete for your attention, maintaining multiple relationships, the power to say &quot;no&quot;—it pumps up your ego in a way that feels amazing at first but eventually reveals itself to be a bit empty. You end up creating these parallel lives, each relationship its own little universe that never quite achieves escape velocity. Sometimes that&#39;s exactly what you want. But it gets old.</p><p>In the midst of all this, I met some truly remarkable people. Despite things not working out romantically in the long run, I&#39;m genuinely grateful for their presence in my life. I don&#39;t think failed relationships are a waste of time, not every connection needs to last forever to be meaningful. Some people are just passing through your life, leaving it better than they found it. And hopefully you leave them better than you found them. I also fucked up, more than once. I hurt people who didn&#39;t deserve it—made promises I didn&#39;t keep, acted in ways that I&#39;m not proud of. Sometimes other people had to pay the price of my learning curve.</p><p>The one thing I was consistent about was being radically open and honest about everything, including seeing other people. Every time I tried to be &quot;strategic&quot; it backfired spectacularly. The whole pickup artist mythology about being a manipulative seductor is complete bullshit.</p><p><strong>The Dating</strong></p><p>Sex is easy to get in enormous quantities; finding someone you actually <em>like</em> is basically impossible. In the end, the game is probabilistic—you have to keep trying, keep meeting people, keep rolling the dice until you find something real. The scariest thing is that compatibility is mostly ineffable. The evidence collected <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6yiayg5QWtWme4JN8/anatomy-of-a-dating-document?commentId=ctD7rHdPpwdSW8jMt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by gwern</a> is extremely interesting, and basically boils down to this: it&#39;s impossible to predict a couple&#39;s romantic success based on their explicit characteristics. Understanding this also helped me understand why the relationship with Alice didn&#39;t work out. The best you can do is try to minimize false negatives by letting go of your preconceptions and dating broadly.</p><p>That said, I found myself drawn to women who were independent, challenging, intelligent, creative, and unapologetically weird, the ones who weren&#39;t entirely sane but were intensely curious about the world. Other than lack of physical attraction, the most typical reason I would reject someone was &quot;they&#39;re boring&quot;—after spending years hanging out with 155 IQ schizophrenic metapolitical anarchomonarchists on the internet, conversation with normal people can start to feel a bit plain.</p><p>More on this in a future essay.</p><h4 id="The-Sex"><a href="#The-Sex" class="headerlink" title="The Sex"></a>The Sex</h4><p>Great sex comes from the same place as great relationships: openness, honesty, and genuine confidence. When you&#39;re comfortable with yourself and actually give a fuck about your partner&#39;s pleasure, spectacular things can happen. Sometimes your partners will orgasm so hard they start crying, and that&#39;s a good thing.</p><p>Just as runners for decades believed breaking that barrier was physically impossible, most people have convinced themselves that transcendent sex is out of reach, that &quot;good enough&quot; is the best they can hope for. They&#39;ve internalized stories about how men are just naturally bad at sex, how women are difficult to please, how great sexual chemistry is rare and magical rather than just a learnable skill. But mastering this skill means leaving your ego at the door.</p><p>The truth is this: the bar for men is on the fucking floor. The vast majority of guys are absolutely terrible at sex, to a degree that is almost unbelievable. I met multiple beautiful women with bodycounts in the dozens who had essentially never had good sex in their lives before meeting me. Not because I&#39;m some magical sex god, but simply because I gave a damn and put some passion into it.</p><p>A strange realization: I have vastly <a href="https://x.com/Aella_Girl/status/1874602104972828920" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more sex than Aella</a>, who is famous for being a whore. If even <em>Aella</em> isn&#39;t getting laid enough, what hope is there for normal people? How do we <em>increase the fuck rate</em> for the masses? I think the answer is depressingly simple: most people don&#39;t have more sex because the sex they do have is mediocre at best. They settle for &quot;good enough&quot; and stop looking for better, stop trying to <em>be</em> better. It&#39;s like someone declaring they don&#39;t like sushi after only eating gas station California rolls. So, to answer <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2005/05/why_dont_people.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tyler&#39;s question</a>: people don&#39;t have more sex because most sex is lame.</p><p>More on this, too, in a future essay.</p><h3 id="Imaginary-Barriers"><a href="#Imaginary-Barriers" class="headerlink" title="Imaginary Barriers"></a>Imaginary Barriers</h3><p><strong>Nice guys:</strong> a lot of people think you need to be a jerk to get laid, but that&#39;s just another fake social script. The truth is this: being &quot;nice&quot; from a position of weakness is dating kryptonite. Women can smell the desperation. But being genuinely kind from a position of confidence and abundance is incredibly attractive. The difference isn&#39;t in the behavior itself, but in the energy behind it. True kindness flows from having clear boundaries and standards, from being genuinely interested in someone&#39;s wellbeing and pleasure—not from being a pushover hoping to trade basic decency for sexual access.</p><p><strong>The power to say no:</strong></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/eigenrobot/status/1744415149983690876" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="/images/eigen_sayingno-dc00ef03ddc8a6f7a9f81bf4cac21f87.png" class="nofancybox"></a></p><p>One of the most liberating discoveries wasn&#39;t the sex, but realizing I could...say no to it. At some point I started waiting for the second date before getting physical—the connection was better, the sex more comfortable. But it resulted in the strange scenario of girls practically pleading to come back to my place on first dates. Women find it bizarre when you say &quot;no&quot; in that situation, it&#39;s just not in their script. They&#39;re so accustomed to men desperate to get their dick wet that when you flip the dynamic, it short-circuits their entire understanding of dating.</p><p>This whole pathetic dance of men begging for a crumb of sex, trying to push the girl to come back to his place while she resists and acts as a gatekeeper to sex, etc.—it&#39;s entirely a choice. A collective delusion that persists only because everyone keeps playing their assigned role. You can simply reject it.</p><p><strong>Abundance mindset:</strong> when I had 2-3 concurrent partners, I became extremely selective and rejected almost everyone I went out with. The psychological impact of abundance is to make you secure in your own judgments, to push up your standards to where they should be in the first place and stick with them. Scarcity creates artificial commitment to bad relationships. Abundance helps you realize that compatible partners aren&#39;t unicorns—they&#39;re just people you haven&#39;t met yet. And entering a serious relationship with the perspective and attitude that abundance bestows on you makes everything so much easier.</p><p><strong>Cold approach:</strong> the barrier I have not broken yet. I&#39;m too fucking terrified to cold approach women in public, yet at the same time, I&#39;ve had way more sex than friends who regularly chat up strangers. A friend casually mentioned hitting on a cute girl in a museum, talking to her for an hour, and then bailing unceremoniously, not knowing how to close the deal. The very thought of hitting on a stranger makes me sink into the floor, melting through the boards, my liquefied body dripping right into the third circle of Dante&#39;s hell, but I have infinitely (literally, divided by zero) more sex than he did at the time. This makes absolutely no sense and completely contradicts conventional wisdom about &quot;getting out there&quot;.</p><h3 id="Finding-Fluorescence"><a href="#Finding-Fluorescence" class="headerlink" title="Finding Fluorescence"></a>Finding Fluorescence</h3><p>Once sex becomes easy, it loses some of its mystique. I found myself having as much sex as I wanted, but it was a fleeting satisfaction that left me yearning for more. One of the notes in my dating journal, following a breakup, reads:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>All I&#39;m left with is a nostalgic longing for a future that never was.</p></div></blockquote><p>Maybe that&#39;s not such a bad thing. Getting your heart stomped when someone doesn&#39;t reciprocate your feelings is a special kind of hell, but it turned out to be a necessary step.</p><p>Last year, I wrote to myself:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>I&#39;m not looking for someone who ticks my boxes. I&#39;m after &quot;I can&#39;t believe you exist&quot;, I want to be amazed, I am after fluorescent effervescence and electric bolts running up my spine, I want to feel like I&#39;m on amphetamines 24/7, entirely incapable of sleeping, lose my job and end up in an early grave because of my romantic obsession.</p></div></blockquote><p>Perhaps my relationship standards had been set by reading too many Russian novels, but then, improbably, unbelievably, astonishingly, I found her! And while boatloads of casual sex was pretty damn good, it doesn&#39;t hold a candle to settling down in a loving, inspiring relationship with a fantastic partner.</p><p>But here&#39;s the thing: I don&#39;t think I could have found it, or been ready for it, without all the fucking around first. The experience, the confidence that comes from abundance, from knowing you can walk away, from having your pick of partners—it fundamentally changes how you interact with the world. Without experiencing the wrong relationships—the boring ones, the sexually charged but emotionally empty ones, the ones where you&#39;re more therapist than partner—you lack the contrast needed to recognize something extraordinary when it does appear.</p><p>This stuff often fucking hurts. There&#39;s a reason the Buddha thought desire was the root of all suffering. But you know what? <a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2025/02/03/the-alchemist-and-his-quicksilver/">Fuck the Buddha</a>. Some pain is worth having.</p><p>Sometimes I wonder if getting into all this so late in life was a mistake. Did those years of celibacy permanently rewire my brain? Did I miss some crucial developmental window? A <a href="https://twitter.com/alexeyguzey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">friend of mine</a> said that celibacy has already destroyed my psyche. But I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true, it&#39;s never too late to fall in love.</p><p>So, what&#39;s next? Back to the books, or happy-ever-after relationship wireheading? One thing about breaking through arbitrary limitations is that it leaves you facing real ones, like how to spend the few days you have left on the planet. Nobody knows what the future holds, but I&#39;m really happy with my life right now.</p><p><strong>Fin</strong></p><p>We&#39;re all role-playing, and most people don&#39;t realize that they can just switch roles. You can just choose to be whatever you want. You Can Just Do Stuff™. So here&#39;s the four-minute mile of Fucking: if you&#39;re a reasonably put-together guy in his mid-30s, you could be having threesomes with cute college students. You simply have to make the choice to do it, the barriers are all inside you. If you&#39;re actually handsome or successful, you can basically live like Leo in perpetuity, though you&#39;ll probably get bored of it faster than he does.</p><p>But even if that&#39;s not what you want, I still recommend making sex <em>your</em> autistic special interest for a year or two. Not just for the obvious benefits, but because it opens up new mental and emotional states, teaches you surprising things about how people work, and most importantly, lets you enter a serious relationship knowing exactly what you want and what you&#39;re worth. And then you can make an informed decision: do I want to go monk mode, or full Simon Sarris?

The guests: artists, fashion designers, jewelers, and one or two people with real jobs sprinkled in for diversity. Two immaculately groomed poodles run around and entertain the visitors. Before us, an exactingly curated procession of morsels: blini with salmon and caviar, black brioche with cured egg yolk and parmigiano foam, ravioli with pumpkin and cod with browned butter and crispy sage. The apartment, naturally, is luxurious without being gauche (that would be unforgivable) every piece selected with impeccable taste and just the right amount of personal touch. And so we rate our years, the numbers start coming out, and it is a parade of 2s and 3s, each delivered with a sort of practiced <em>weltschmerz</em>. One of the guests plans to commit suicide soon. The only 10 in the room: me. Is it because I&#39;ve been perfectly happy, carefree? No—not quite.</p><p>I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about this lately, about my relationship with suffering. All this pain in the past few months, I think most people would recoil from it. Instead, I&#39;m drawn towards it. Is it psychological masochism? The intensity of emotion—it makes me feel alive, present, it gives me a heightened awareness of everything, inside and out.</p><p>I compulsively play with the pain in my mind: my thoughts trace its edges like fingers mapping an unknown shape in the dark; I run my mind over its surface to feel its texture, sometimes sharpcutting, sometimes soft and dull; I press against it, and see how it reacts; I savor it, let it melt in my mouth and glory in its bitterness; I feel the heat radiating from it like the dying embers of a fire late at night, and other times like x-rays blasting out of a black hole; I spin it around examining it from each and every angle one by one, appreciating its style from every point of view; I push it far away and look at it with a telescope to admire its entire structure, and then bring it right up to me and inspect every microscopic little element on its surface, and then sometimes I dive in and give myself over to it and let it envelop me and permeate my whole being until I feel and perceive nothing else and time stops completely.</p><p>(And sometimes I will take a good look at myself as though I were a case study: &quot;Subject displays strong tendencies toward self-dramatization, perpetually overthinking and rationalizing their emotions through baroque metaphors.&quot;)</p><p>I am even amused and entertained by it. I laugh at my life and these surprising and delightful and wretchedly dark alleyways it&#39;s leading me down. A dull psychiatrist would say it&#39;s nothing more than a defense mechanism. I don&#39;t believe that at all. This is not about protecting myself or &quot;processing&quot;. It&#39;s &quot;saying Yes to life even in its strangest and hardest problems&quot;—not to be liberated from terror and pity, but &quot;in order to be oneself the eternal joy of becoming&quot;. There is a kind of distance there, but it&#39;s not a detachment, it is rather a doubling of perception. It&#39;s a way of transmuting things. It&#39;s not that the pain becomes less real or less painful—it becomes <em>more</em> real, <em>more</em> vibrant, <em>more</em> itself—but it also becomes something else simultaneously.</p><p>To treat reality as a medium, to live life with the texture of a novel—this is part of the bargain of being me: simultaneously the author and his character. The paradox: rather than dulling your emotions, this splitting of consciousness instead makes everything more vivid. Like adding a mirror to a mirror and creating—infinity. When you view yourself from the third person, as someone whose life you are sketching out, every powerful emotion is a delight. And it&#39;s not just pain that works this way—joy, too, takes on this double character, I&#39;m swept up in it while also watching myself being swept up, and somehow the watching makes the feeling more intense rather than less. I am both the alchemist and his quicksilver, the sculptor and the clay, <a href="https://img.rss.com/the-antifada/800/cover_af0cba9447ae436aa637d6450bacb33d.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>creature and creator</em></a>.</p><p>I love my life — <em>aesthetically</em>.</p><p>It&#39;s not a mechanical collecting of experiences to dissect on a couch or on the page. Baudelaire writes of the artist-dandy as &quot;a man possessing at every moment the genius of childhood, in other words a genius for whom no edge of life is blunted.&quot; Not &quot;making meaning&quot; after the fact, but in the experience of every moment. A perpetual state of creative tension, of <em>becoming</em> and <em>self-overcoming</em>.</p><p>That is―<em>Anti-Buddhism</em>. Self-examination not to feel less, but to feel <em>more</em>. Not to avoid suffering, but to <em>glory in life</em>. Not to detach but to <em>overcome</em>. Not to escape, but to <em>revel</em> in life! Not to transcend, but to <em>heighten</em>. Cultivating not detachment, but <em>intensity</em> and <em>sensitivity</em>, with a poet&#39;s intentionality, making the self into an artist in the joy of its own eternal becoming. Creating a layer of aesthetic appreciation that runs parallel to the raw experience, and shapes it. Saying <em>No!</em> to the inhuman, life-denying ascetic nihilism of seeking &quot;liberation&quot; from attachment and suffering, <em>No!</em> to the <a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2022/10/10/against-effective-altruism/"><em>naiveties about pleasure and pain</em></a> that constitute this intellectual morass that surrounds us.</p><p>Everywhere people seek to smooth life&#39;s edges. Instead of riding its violent waves, they seek to transform them into a tepid swimming pool suitable for gentle laps without the least chance of drowning. They cling desperately onto old religions when they talk about enlightenment but mean only quietude, when they preach transcendence but mean only escape. What petty bargains with existence! This is not wisdom, but cowardice masquerading as enlightenment. They seek to tame, diminish, and bridle everything that should be wild! What is this if not a rejection of life itself? Life, which knows nothing of balance but only of tension, nothing of peace but only of creative strife! What sickness entices you to paddle in the shallows instead of making infinite demands on life and always finding yourself in some new wilderness? For &quot;life consists with wildness, and the most alive is the wildest.&quot;</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>The discipline of suffering, of <em>great</em> suffering – do you not know that it is <em>this</em> discipline alone which has created every elevation of mankind hitherto? That tension of the soul in misfortune which cultivates its strength, its terror at the sight of great destruction, its inventiveness and bravery in undergoing, enduring, interpreting, exploiting misfortune, and whatever of depth, mystery, mask, spirit, cunning and greatness has been bestowed upon it – has it not been bestowed through suffering, through the discipline of great suffering?</p></div></blockquote><p>I used to view the <em>tortured artist</em> with both envy and skepticism. It was a Romantic idea that I thought I wanted, while at the same time dismissing it as an affectation, a trope, a false source of inspiration, or perhaps just a tool to seduce women with. Sour grapes, I suppose. Now I have become him (inadvertently? or by design?) and the view from the inside is not quite what I was expecting...it is both more silly and more real than I thought it&#39;d be. There is certainly an absurd theater to it all. But the authenticity lies precisely in embracing the sublime <em>and</em> the ridiculous, in realizing that the real thing is both more serious and more playful than the cliché suggests. But it&#39;s not about turning pain into art, it&#39;s this splitting of consciousness that makes the darkest moments shimmer with beauty. Pain is not raw material to be processed later—it&#39;s already art in the moment of perception, if you&#39;ve developed the right kind of vision. &quot;Art from pain&quot; is shallow, I am talking about a methodology of life and consciousness: <em>Amor fati</em>!</p><p><em>The great sickness of our age</em>: the belief that life is something to be managed rather than a drama to be enacted.</p><p>Anyway, this is all a bit melodramatic if not pretentious...</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>—A wonderful piece.</p><div class="subscribediv" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:250px;margin-top:30px"><form class="validate" action="https://fantasticanachronism.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=2a6ff66ec7039625cb12680d5&amp;amp;id=f713c1306c" method="post" id="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" target="_blank"><div class="mc-field-group"><input class="required email" type="email" name="EMAIL" id="mce-EMAIL" placeholder="Type your email..."></div><div class="clear" id="mce-responses"><div class="respose" id="mce-error-response" style="display:none"></div><div class="respose" id="mce-success-response" style="display:none"></div></div><div style="position:absolute;left:-5000px" aria-hidden="true"><input type="text" name="b_2a6ff66ec7039625cb12680d5_f713c1306c" tabindex="-1"></div><div class="clear"><input type="submit" value="Subscribe" name="subscribe" id="mc-embedded-subscribe" clas="button"></div></form></div></div></div><br><hr class="postDivider"><br><div class="post"><h1 class="post-title"><a href="/2025/01/27/the-best-and-worst-books-i-read-in-2023-2024/">The Best and Worst Books I Read in 2023 &amp; 2024</a></h1><div class="post-meta">2025-01-27</div><a class="disqus-comment-count" data-page-id="/2025/01/27/the-best-and-worst-books-i-read-in-2023-2024/" href="/2025/01/27/the-best-and-worst-books-i-read-in-2023-2024/#commento"></a><div class="post-content"><h1 id="The-Best"><a href="#The-Best" class="headerlink" title="The Best"></a>The Best</h1><img src="/images/bb24_solenoid-07ee84455d14bafa234e0afdd2bdc018.jpg" class="floatleft nofancybox"><p>Mircea Cărtărescu, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Solenoid-Mircea-Cartarescu/dp/1646052021?crid=8HRDWX32UB17&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.gVjqr2J8yBjfEn-oPEyurFNdnoV2Ocf2M-60WSRc9IDJcHe-zdV5e0TwWQXnVHSesZBidYRqbCGjAixuHj0lwWT1Kc0WffU1q-zu9Y-1yH66XxkvunK3xbaj4drVsskfm0Qi6Q3_0AJZyjl2irbcBgIQoitIbUbJFiQ_1U5rgVDXf0UQVXey-Lw1ozI7oBv5A8Ld5G_yyQweBLXhQkw_IOJ5VVd_fpcIvAWG5kfw3ryjde0Xf6PQfA-yhQYSOe2i7oc-ORZ9w0uYfTyXoJxZMq-hAfwpzMc-hdv4VBW8ESlearCewtVTiIw3OidNK_HKAeFsTGOcr-62XL8PpXqsO-KvxFPciJjwX-2u2d6idW4zPOjVExPhkrpKqYK28XPDe980_3nFInyneZOuUQgBnjnxXO9S0iYkR1V2l8h4eP2LKwBF_i2igYEeg6waU-0c.VpmH1cYipYTQp0duFJhsn5XCkION0p5-lq8xyr40KDs&dib_tag=se&keywords=solenoid&qid=1737661559&sprefix=solen%2Caps%2C196&sr=8-6&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=638120af9ad37df5e20f064c0a6ce097&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Solenoid</a></strong></p><p>A mix of fiction, history, and autobiography as a failed author and high school teacher navigates 80s Bucharest.

Until one of us suddenly understands, because he was predestined to understand, that within the plane of the paper escape is impossible. That the exit, simple and open wide, is perpendicular to the paper, in a third dimension that up until that moment was inconceivable.

The Braudelian world-view is felt on every page, the interlocking systems of trade, production, geography, crops, animals and people. Mountains shape trade routes, climate patterns determine harvests, sea currents guide merchants - everything connects to everything else in Braudel&#39;s Mediterranean. Written in a Nazi POW camp, it brought a fresh perspective on how to think about history: not kings and battles, but the slow dance of geography and climate, the rhythms of peasant life, the endless circulation of ships and goods. Immensely ambitious and beautifully written.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>But we cannot hope for precise measurements; at most we shall discover an order of magnitude. In this respect the Mediterranean was still broadly speaking the same size in the sixteenth century as it had been in Roman times, that is, over a thousand years earlier. Or to put it another way, the Mediterranean in the sixteenth century was comparable, mutatis mutandis, to the entire globe in 1939. It was vast, immeasurable, and its reputation as a &#39;human&#39; area was earned only by contrast with those other monsters which sixteenth-century man was just beginning to tackle - the Atlantic Ocean, not to mention the Pacific. These were truly monsters, alongside which the Mediterranean was more like a domestic animal, but certainly not the &#39;lake&#39; it has become in the twentieth century, the sunny resort of tourists and yachts where one can always reach land within a few hours and along whose length the traveller could be transported in the Orient Express. To understand what it was like in the sixteenth century, one must mentally magnify its area to a maximum and draw on remembered images from travellers&#39; tales of the days when months, years, even a whole lifetime, could be spent on a voyage.</p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="/images/bb24_suttree-c6747799690246732fbd8278f7718d89.jpg" class="floatleft nofancybox"><p>Cormac McCarthy, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Suttree-Cormac-McCarthy/dp/0679736328?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.oosrep83q9Uudok2J2r8OpEu3xjehAzasMW-EnoD3p6gZ_qhNODqHyAnRCpsd75JJtt1aSnhNhhVNuFfhAEW12u7Zi8YF71its9-9IOmmDsi-rAUwvsuSMjs8PKhgY_pCTFNsV5U2qlvUH9IYhOHy7al7s_Jc9snaaq0Z22OF_9JHdwCKPnckO2c9uE5ziu4DI4FJGUBvlxcpvmbTfeQhHpd4raxwNu2UOWDnF67oB8.vq0Ck12z-3I4O9X7koNc9DXp8nHjqFEb_366VwR0Phk&dib_tag=se&keywords=Suttree&qid=1737661670&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=2ce749dbcf217d327313ab3bdbf1b686&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Suttree</strong></a></p><p>Basically nothing happens in this book, and it is absolutely spectacular.

It doesn&#39;t focus strongly on the science, more on the person and his relations, and the recurring theme is one of petty resentment and inability to understand von Neumann because he was simply so far above and ahead of everyone else around him. The resentment often manifests as a kind of petty moralism, and Labatut basically makes everyone in von Neumann&#39;s life look rather pathetic. I don&#39;t know how factual that is, but it certainly works as a literary device.</p><p>The second part concerns Lee Sedol and AlphaGo. It&#39;s a bit drawn out, but it&#39;s an exciting story that&#39;s well-told. The point is essentially to underscore just how much von Neumann could see 60+ years ago, when everyone around him was essentially blind.

Raw, intimate, with complete lack of dignity, it felt like an invasion of her privacy. Living life novelistically. How lovers really only exist in our minds.

In a way this is a portrayal of incredibly deep passion, on the other hand her approach also makes it feel really shallow: he&#39;s handsome, drives a fast car, career-minded. We have absolutely no clue what her passion is for exactly, but that&#39;s exactly the point, that the reason of the passion is irrelevant or unknowable or inexplicable or not worth explaining, what really matters is her own experience and what she takes from it (&quot;I do not wish to explain my passion—that would imply that it was a mistake or some disorder I need to justify—I just want to describe it.&quot; and &quot;Whether or not he was “worth it” is of no consequence.&quot;) She considers herself luckier than him because she has the obsession and he does not, that really stood out as the cornerstone of the whole thing.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>When he rang to arrange a meeting, his long-awaited call had no effect on me and I remained locked in the same state of anxiety as before. My condition was such that not even the sound of his voice could make me happy. It was all infinite emptiness, except when we were together making love. And even then I dreaded the moments to come, when he would be gone. I experienced pleasure like a future pain. I longed to end the affair, so as not to be at the mercy of a phone call, so as not to suffer, realizing at once what this would entail, seconds after the separation: a series of days with nothing to wait for. I preferred to carry on at any cost—let him have another woman, or even several. (In other words, accepting a torment far greater than the one that made me want to leave him.) Compared to such emptiness, my present situation seemed enviable and my jealousy a sort of frail privilege which I would have been mad to want to end since one day it would end anyway, outside my control, when he would leave the country or would decide to stop seeing me.</p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="/images/bb24_fragnemt-bd42689be46c98209f3f3302f770d93f.jpg" class="floatleft nofancybox"><p>Ctrlcreep, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fragnemt-ctrlcreep/dp/1795354437?crid=9HSHCLOGZPG2&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Prk6XNrVplhXtvdiykMQ6Q._KWCiiz9KrSwxp3T1Qk8kJ54JmaUVbMNXX05aWMRWQo&dib_tag=se&keywords=ctrl+creep&qid=1737661859&sprefix=ctrlcre%2Caps%2C184&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=f52f2f60f2d0f4552eedfe9b53832600&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fragnemt</a></strong></p><p>A collection of tweets and very short stories from @ctrlcreep. &quot;Why would I want to own a collection of tweets&quot;, you might think, but these are brilliantly etched little gems: dense, fantastical, inventive, awe-inspiring and terrifying.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>The forest&#39;s immortal animals are weary of life.

Then, wolfishly seen, all human activities became horribly absurd and misplaced, stupid and vain. But it was exactly the same when Harry felt and behaved as a wolf and showed others his teeth and felt hatred and enmity against all human beings and their lying and degenerate manners and customs.

We ran to the airport and insisted we were veterinarians and that we had to see the vac- cination papers for the animals. We shouted so loudly that they admitted they had no papers, and they embarrassedly unloaded the animals from the plane. We just put them into our truck and left.

He displays none of the curiosity, none of the interest in data (while Braudel&#39;s work is filled with numbers, it would not surprise me if Arrighi was innumerate). But he does share Braudel&#39;s attitude towards growth (which is to say that he ignores it).

We could at least see.</p></div></blockquote><p>A <em>pleb filter</em> is a piece of art which, by virtue of its impenetrability, &quot;filters out&quot; people with bad taste. What makes the pleb filter such an entertaining addition to online Discourse is that it&#39;s a ready-made kafkatrap, a perfect concept for trolls and shitposters to weaponize: once an artwork has been declared a &quot;pleb filter&quot;—no matter how absurd the claim—any disagreement instantly labels you an unsophisticated rube, a pleb who has been <em>filtered</em>.</p><p>Thus one may find oneself in futile internet conversations trying desperately to explain that, no, <em>Ishtar</em> really is quite bad, that Ringo is not the best Beatle, and that Joel Schumacher&#39;s nipple-Batman is <em>not</em> actually a sublime work of misunderstood cinematic genius. The troll choices are virtually infinite, but work best when applied to creations that are universally agreed to be terrible: the prequels, <em>St. Anger</em>, or the <em>oeuvre</em> of 6ix9ine.</p><p>There are fake filters, like Tarr&#39;s <em>Werckmeister Hamornies</em>—art which tries to be challenging and hints at great depths while actually being quite shallow. A picture of a pool drawn on a piece of paper, and often frustrating because they are a pleb&#39;s idea of a pleb filter. Still, some (like <em>The Magus</em> or <em>The Recognitions</em>) have their charms.</p><p>Finally we have the actual pleb filters, works which are both brilliant and inaccessible. <em>Trout Mask Replica</em>, Michael Mann&#39;s <em>Miami Vice</em>, <em>Faust Part Two</em>, <em>Enter the Void</em>, the <em>Paradiso</em>, Season 2 of <em>True Detective</em>, <em>Fanged Noumena</em>, the <em>Iliad&#39;s</em> catalogue of ships.</p><h2 id="The-IQ-of-Shitposters"><a href="#The-IQ-of-Shitposters" class="headerlink" title="The IQ of Shitposters"></a>The IQ of Shitposters</h2><p>To proclaim the genius of <em>Hamlet</em> is commonplace; to successfully defend <em>The Two Gentlemen of Verona</em> as Shakespeare&#39;s greatest play takes some <em>serious intellectual firepower</em>. Defending the indefensible is a great signal of brainpower: a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/14747049211000317" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent study</a> finds that &quot;bullshit ability is associated with an individual’s intelligence and individuals capable of producing more satisfying bullshit are judged by second-hand observers to be more intelligent&quot;. The pleb filter is not just a fun tool for trolling, it also offers a great opportunity to show off one&#39;s smarts.</p><p>It is genuinely challenging to truly appreciate the talent and artistry that goes into bullshit—Armond White (perhaps the greatest bullshitter of our time) is himself a pleb filter, perhaps the ultimate one. Some are liable to react with horror, but I think it&#39;s a game worth indulging in.</p><p>At the same time, there&#39;s a countersignaling game being played. On the <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/22/right-is-the-new-left/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">barber pole</a> of intellectual status, the highbrow will adopt lowbrow tastes in order to signal that they&#39;re not midwits. Thus we get <a href="https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/https://doi.org/10.1093/jcr/ucz049" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fancy restaurants serving mac and cheese</a>, and big-brained shitposters defending <em>Showgirls</em>. It is no coincidence that the very idea of the pleb filter was invented on a website whose users are famous for being very smart and pretending to be very stupid.</p><p>Sometimes isolated communities spiral local status markers into overdrive, creating unintentional bad pleb filters, with wild signaling and counter-signaling battles cascading downwards, leaving outside onlookers utterly bewildered. The famously unintelligible world of high fashion offers a memorable, and sometimes beautiful, instance of this phenomenon.</p><h2 id="Criticism-and-the-Anxiety-of-the-Filter"><a href="#Criticism-and-the-Anxiety-of-the-Filter" class="headerlink" title="Criticism and the Anxiety of the Filter"></a>Criticism and the Anxiety of the Filter</h2><p>The pleb filter is also a formidable force in the realm of art criticism: the critic must always maintain a position of superiority over his audience, for it is this stance which gives him the authority to dictate what is good or bad. He must therefore never be filtered, and even more importantly never <em>appear</em> to be filtered. Thus he will praise formulaic &quot;high culture&quot; garbage, lest he be mistaken for someone who doesn&#39;t <em>get it</em>.</p><p>When a critic encounters a work that eludes his understanding, something that may surpass his grasp, the anxiety of being filtered becomes <em>palpable</em>—and he often reacts to such works in an extreme way by denigrating them. This is why so many of the great classics were initially met with unfavorable reviews: <em>The Thing</em>, <em>Moby-Dick</em>, <em>Lolita</em>, half of Kubrick&#39;s movies. <em>Chimes at Midnight</em>, Orson Welles&#39;s best film, was savaged when it came out and barely got distribution due to the terrible advance reviews. The anxiety of the filter is to the critic what the anxiety of influence is to the artist.</p><h2 id="The-Case-of-Michael-Thomas-Green"><a href="#The-Case-of-Michael-Thomas-Green" class="headerlink" title="The Case of Michael Thomas Green"></a>The Case of Michael Thomas Green</h2><p>The most interesting pleb filters are those that lie exactly on the line between being a troll pleb filter and a real pleb filter: <em>Speed Racer</em>, <em>Love Exposure</em>, the <em>Book of Numbers</em>, the <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> series, perhaps <em>Dhalgren</em>—works where powerful arguments can be made in both directions, works stuck in the limbo between stupidity and genius. Who can forget the iconic image of Sean Connery in the red trunks from <em>Zardoz</em>? There&#39;s a particular form of failure that is borne of great ambition. Take <em>Southland Tales</em>, for example, an utterly bizarre work of deranged grandeur. It is bad <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7YXONuF3dk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beyond belief</a>. And yet there&#39;s something there, something alluring, something that pulls you in and props you up and keeps you watching.</p><p>In 2001, Tom Green wrote, directed, and starred in <em>Freddy Got Fingered</em>, a stupid yet brilliantly fearless comedy about a failed cartoonist and his relationship with his family. The critics hated it, filling their reviews with adjectives like &quot;embarrassing&quot;, &quot;witless&quot;, &quot;vile&quot;, and &quot;sad&quot;, but the film maintains a dedicated following to this day. Some have described it as a surrealist masterpiece, others as a $14 million dollar prank on a movie studio, others as a film before its time. Nathan Rabin writes that &quot;studios exist precisely to keep films this audacious, original, and transgressive from ever hitting theaters&quot;, while <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v_wfECtCvQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lindsay Ellis</a> calls Green &quot;the Orson Welles of our time&quot; and describes <em>Freddy</em> as a film of pure insight into the soul of its creator and a &quot;dadaist masterpiece&quot;.</p><p><em>Freddy</em> offers a perfect example of the anxiety of the filter: Ebert gave it zero stars, but in his infamous review he compares Tom Green to Buñuel, and declares that &quot;the day may come when &quot;Freddy Got Fingered&quot; is seen as a milestone of neo-surrealism.&quot; 16 months after his initial review, Ebert was still thinking about the inscrutable genius of <em>Freddy</em>, writing in his review of <em>Stealing Harvard</em>:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Seeing Tom Green reminded me, as how could it not, of his movie Freddy Got Fingered, which was so poorly received by the film critics that it received only one lonely, apologetic positive review on the Tomatometer. I gave it—let&#39;s see—zero stars. Bad movie, especially the scene where Green was whirling the newborn infant around his head by its umbilical cord. But the thing is, I remember Freddy Got Fingered more than a year later. I refer to it sometimes. It is a milestone. And for all its sins, it was at least an ambitious movie, a go-for-broke attempt to accomplish something. It failed, but it has not left me convinced that Tom Green doesn&#39;t have good work in him. Anyone with his nerve and total lack of taste is sooner or later going to make a movie worth seeing.</p></div></blockquote><h2 id="Ἐγὼ-δ-̓οἶδα-μὲν-ὡς-αἱ-ὑπερμεγέθεις-φύσεις-ἥκιστα-καθαραί"><a href="#Ἐγὼ-δ-̓οἶδα-μὲν-ὡς-αἱ-ὑπερμεγέθεις-φύσεις-ἥκιστα-καθαραί" class="headerlink" title="Ἐγὼ δ ̓οἶδα μὲν ὡς αἱ ὑπερμεγέθεις φύσεις ἥκιστα καθαραί"></a>Ἐγὼ δ ̓οἶδα μὲν ὡς αἱ ὑπερμεγέθεις φύσεις ἥκιστα καθαραί</h2><p>Longinus, in his essay <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/17957/17957-h/17957-h.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>On the Sublime</em></a>, observes that mediocre artists don&#39;t make mistakes: their works are faultless because they stay within convention and take no risks. Perfection is merely an artifact of insufficient ambition. Errour is the purview of the Great!</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Is it not by risking nothing, by never aiming high, that a writer of low or middling powers keeps generally clear of faults and secure of blame? Whereas the loftier walks of literature are by their very loftiness perilous? [...] Though I have myself noted not a few faulty passages in Homer and in other authors of the highest rank, and though I am far from being partial to their failings, nevertheless I would call them not so much wilful blunders as oversights which were allowed to pass unregarded through that contempt of little things, that “brave disorder,” which is natural to an exalted genius; and I still think that the greater excellences, though not everywhere equally sustained, ought always to be voted to the first place in literature, if for no other reason, for the mere grandeur of soul they reveal. [...] Would you rather be a Homer or an Apollonius?</p></div></blockquote><p>Bolaño plays with this notion in the famous passage on the bookish pharmacist, but I find the most striking echo of this idea is found in Flaubert&#39;s final novel, <em>Bouvard et Pécuchet</em>. He spent nearly a decade working on it, but did not manage to complete it before his death. It is a strange, repetitive work teetering on the brink between comedy and tragedy; ostensibly a work of social criticism, it is really about Flaubert looking inwardly. And it was a radical departure from anything that he (or anyone else) had written before. He writes in a letter:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>At times, the immense scope of this book stuns me. What will come of it? I only hope I’m not deceiving myself into writing something goofy rather than sublime. No, I think not! Something tells me I’m on the right path! But it will be one or the other.</p></div></blockquote><p>He even places some self-relferential meta-commentary on just this topic <em>within</em> the book—</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>He was assailed by doubts. For if mediocre minds (as Longinus observed) are incapable of faults, then faults are committed by the masters—and we should admire them? That’s too much!</p></div></blockquote><p>And for critics, it is exactly this ability to appreciate something great and flawed, as opposed to something small-souled and perfect, that separates the plebeian from the noble taste.</p><h2 id="We-Yearn-Nonetheless"><a href="#We-Yearn-Nonetheless" class="headerlink" title="...We Yearn, Nonetheless..."></a>...We Yearn, Nonetheless...</h2><p>What unites these works in the interstice between the goofy and the sublime is a <em>reckless</em> ambition that goes against all standards of good taste, no not even <em>against</em> but <em>beyond</em>, powered by some unprincipled eruption of creative <em>élan</em>, and not due to some misguided contrarianism but because the old standards are simply incapable of containing the artist&#39;s vision which, pushing out against its own limits, bursts like a star. They are a dive off the edge, a rejection of any interpolation between known points, a heroic leap beyond the confines of the billion-dimensional <a href="https://twitter.com/alexeyguzey/status/1566865664962281472" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latent space of ideas</a>, riding exotic vectors into unknown territories, vectors invisible to to all but their discoverer—what Bolaño had in mind when he was writing about those &quot;great, imperfect, torrential works, books that blaze a path into the unknown&quot;.</p><p>Perhaps this ought to be our attitude not just toward our artistic creations, but also the sculpting of our life and character and <a href="https://twitter.com/literalbanana/status/712913395645685760" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even our beliefs</a>.</p><p>Great philosophers and artists have always endeavored to chart their own path, to avoid recapitulating the shackles of their social conditioning, to find new vantage points that will allow them to see farther and more clearly. Is this not what Plato was after when he sought out the Pythagoreans in Italy? Is this not what Herodotus was looking for when he was interviewing the sages of Egypt and the Scythians of the Don? Is this not what Nick Land was <em>reaching</em> for when he was &quot;lying on the ground, croaking into a mic while Mackay played jungle records in the background&quot;? It doesn&#39;t always work. But one must at least try.</p><p>&quot;There are two kinds of scientific progress,&quot; declares my old pal Prokhor, &quot;the methodical experimentation and categorization which gradually extend the boundaries of knowledge, and the revolutionary leap of genius which redefines and transcends those boundaries. Acknowledging our debt to the former, we yearn, nonetheless, for the latter.&quot; We yearn indeed, but what dear old Prokhor has omitted is that the leap is risky, and the risk usually fails to pay off. Make no mistake—this is a perilous path. <a href="https://scholars-stage.org/tradition-is-smarter-than-you-are/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tradition is Smarter Than You Are</a>, so striking out in your own direction is almost always doomed to fail. Rapid change is almost always for the worse. Human beings are almost constitutionally incapable of taking ideas seriously. Virtually every gene in our body militates against it. &quot;The more people have epistemic learned helplessness and less they trust extreme ideas, the more they&#39;ll just default to playing Civilized American.&quot; But the Romantically low odds of that heroic action have a bewitching appeal, and our social epistemology works only to the extent that brilliant people are able to ignore it.</p><p>This all converges on liberalism, which postulates that ideas are not to be taken seriously.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn255509912" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref255509912">2</sup></a></span> All true masterpieces bear within them an implication of extremism, a deep conviction in the importance of some new, radical idea, an implication that this singular point of view really does matter, and has the strength to overcome all others.

And just a few days ago David Wallace-Wells, discussing the country&#39;s growth problems, <a href="https://archive.is/e1Sfg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote that</a> &quot;the country’s obvious struggles have a very obvious central cause: austerity&quot;.</p><p>There&#39;s just a little problem with all of this: there was never any austerity in the UK. It&#39;s a pure media fabrication that persists only because nobody cares to look at the data.</p><p>So, let us bring out the charts! First of all, the UK has been running deficits for more than 20 years now. The deficits were huge even right in the middle of the supposedly austere period. Living beyond your means is not <em>austerity</em>, it&#39;s <em>profligacy</em>.</p><img src="/images/austerity_deficit-7008bc10b777000cea782813128e7675.png"><p>What does Wallace-Wells say to justify his claims about &quot;austerity&quot;?</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>In the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, and in the name of rebalancing budgets, the Tory-led government set about cutting annual public spending, as a proportion of G.D.P., to 39 percent from 46 percent.</p></div></blockquote><p>This is technically true, but stupid. The 46% figure comes from the middle of the Global Financial Crisis, when GDP dropped by more than 15% and the government was trying to stimulate the economy. A decade later, spending as % of GDP had simply returned to its pre-recession level. This isn&#39;t &quot;austerity&quot;, it&#39;s just good old regular Keynesian countercyclical fiscal policy. In fact, the UK had already escaped from recession in 2010, and it continued to run huge deficits anyway.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn5166307721" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref5166307721">1</sup></a></span></p><img src="/images/austerity_spendingpctgdp-22a50ed6c3c160c6a5bad9bb585c543a.png"><p>And to emphasize just how unsustainable this profligacy has been, the UK&#39;s debt-to-GDP ratio has gone from ~35% to ~100% during this period of &quot;austerity&quot;!</p><img src="/images/austerity_debttogdp-6b4d80fb485781195ba5aa7ef29b5af5.png"><p>Did spending ever actually go <em>down</em>?

This is a potboiler!</p><p>On the other hand we have the deranged visions of his sister, in a Pynchonian absurdist mode. The thriller plotline is quickly abandoned, and the rest of the novel plays out mostly in a series of conversations. Mathematics, physics, the atomic bomb, JFK assassination conspiracy theories, the role of the unconscious: this is a novel of ideas in many ways. At the same time it&#39;s deeply romantic, filled to the brim with longing, regret, loss, and love. It&#39;s an incredibly sad book.</p><p>Overall this is a novel that strikes out in many directions, many times in unsatisfying and imprecise and undisciplined ways, but it somehow achieves an effect. &quot;Blaze paths into the unknown&quot; etc. To the usual McCarthyan mix of Hemingway and Captain Ahab, he now adds heavy doses of Pynchon and DeLillo.</p><p>Perhaps the passenger is the conscious, or the unconscious, or they&#39;re both passengers (probably all of the above).</p><p>The second novel is a series of conversations between Bobby&#39;s sister Alicia and her psychiatrist, a short time before she commits suicide. It&#39;s mostly a companion piece, and many times it feels like Alicia is McCarthy&#39;s mouthpiece. It&#39;s about mathematics and giving up mathematics and the foundation of mathematics, about language, about meaning in a godless world, about the inability to experience the world directly and the effects of various intermediation mechanisms (including language), about love and longing, about the burden of knowledge, about intelligence, evolution and evolutionary psychology, physics and the bomb and the sins of the father.

The story of Operation Anthropoid (to assassinate Reinhard Heydrich in Prague) and everything that led up to it. 257 short chapters, sometimes consisting of nothing more than a quotation. It&#39;s a blend of a mostly-historical retelling of the operation with a ton of metafictional elements on top. Binet constantly comments on the issues with constructing a historical novel, compares his approach to other books and movies, and even brings his personal life into it. Irony, humor, self-consciousness (especially about the author&#39;s view of Heydrich), the tension between history and fiction, and a slow, horrific build-up that absolutely fills you with terror. Incredible that this book can manage such a powerful emotional effect despite the ironic tone. The absurd scenes (whether comical or horrific) are true, which makes the whole thing so strange. Goring is showing off his model train set to Heydrich when he&#39;s there to get the final solution started...</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Anyway, the RSHA hydra has enough heads to keep him busy. So now he has to delegate. He gives each of the RSHA’s seven divisions to a colleague who is selected first and foremost for his abilities rather than his politics—and this is rare enough to be worth mentioning in the lunatic asylum that is the Nazi regime. Heinrich Müller, for example, who is put in charge of the Gestapo—and who identifies so completely with his job that hereafter he is known simply as “Gestapo” Müller—is a former Christian Democrat: an affiliation that does not prevent him from becoming one of the Nazis’ most devastating weapons. The other RSHA offices are given to brilliant intellectuals: youngsters such as Ohlendorf (Inland-SD) and Schellenberg (Ausland-SD), or experienced academics like Six (Written Records). Such men contrast strongly with the cohort of cranks, illiterates, and mental degenerates who populate the Party’s higher echelons. One minor branch of the Gestapo—a status that does not reflect its true importance, but it’s always better to remain discreet with such sensitive subjects—is devoted to Jewish affairs. Heydrich already knows who he wants to run it: that little Austrian Hauptsturmführer who did such good work before, Adolf Eichmann.</p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="/images/bb22_bouvard-2d243a99106e0580f0cbc8268d4fd221.jpg" class="floatright nofancybox"><p>Gustave Flaubert, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bouvard-Pecuchet-P%C3%A9cuchet-Gustave-Flaubert/dp/1564783936?crid=2TPXIKA0DJZIY&keywords=Bouvard+and+Pecuchet&qid=1672244859&sprefix=the+selected+poetry+of+rainer+maria+rilke%2Caps%2C775&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=641a35b2ab65b19d5b842eca16d24a85&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bouvard and Pecuchet</a></strong></p><p>It&#39;s difficult to write anything about this bizarre, unfinished novel.

Dark and beautiful. This may well be the last great novel of the human era in literature. It would be fitting for the 89-year old McCarthy to be writing a coda for himself and humanity at the same time. Especially since he views the 20th century productions of science and engineering as far more important and groundbreaking than those in literature.</p><p>The plot is mostly irrelevant. Both books consist mostly of conversations: bars and restaurants for the first, a psychiatric institution for the second. McCarthy grapples with every idea that&#39;s been on his mind for the last few decades: mathematics, physics, language, the unconscious, the sins of the father, Kant, evolution, psychology, gnosticism, genius. It&#39;s not just a novel of ideas, though—<em>The Passenger</em> is filled with yearning, regret, nostalgia, isolation...just an incredibly melancholic atmosphere in general. Stella Maris is geekier, and basically The Virgin Internal Voice vs The Chad Cerebration: The Novel.</p><p>To the usual mix of Hemingway and Captain Ahab, McCarthy adds strains of Pynchon and DeLillo. It works.</p><p>There&#39;s even a cool, oblique Borges allusion: toward the end, Bobby writes down a couple of lines from a 17th century German poet, Daniel von Czepko.

The &quot;traditional&quot; approach began with large-scale experiments focusing on the wisdom of the crowds, market mechanisms, etc. People were inspired by the predictive power of financial markets and wanted to replicate their strengths in other domains—policy, diplomacy, war, disease, science.</p><p>We quickly began to see a divergence, starting with the &quot;superforecaster&quot; phenomenon: researchers noticed that certain people consistently outperformed the rest, and if you focused on their views you could outperform both the experts and the crowd. Competitive prediction aggregation/market platforms also have serious issues with information sharing between participants, which is a big part of why teams of top forecasters outperform markets as a whole. It has taken a long time for this movement to play out, but I feel it has been accelerating lately and wanted to write down a few comments on where I think forecasting is headed.</p><p>One issue is identifying superforecasters. If you don&#39;t have access to them (they are GJO&#39;s moat in a way), then you need to find them on your own (or at least find a way to reach out to them and attract them). Thus other projects like CSET/INFER ran crowd forecasting platforms and then picked out the top predictors for their &quot;pro team&quot;, for example. Recent <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Dm5eNgyvEwF9ibvzj/participate-in-the-hybrid-forecasting-persuasion-tournament" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI forecasting efforts</a> have also tried to pick out a small number of top forecasters. And then you have groups like <a href="https://www.swiftcentre.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swift</a> and <a href="https://samotsvety.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Samotsvety</a> (as Scott Alexander says, &quot;If the point of forecasting tournaments is to figure out who you can trust, the science has spoken, and the answer is “these guys”.&quot;). Why pay tens of thousands for a prediction market (which takes time and effort to organize) when you can just give a couple of grand to Nuño and get better answers, faster?</p><p>Others have tried to do away with the market mechanism even without having access to top forecasting talent. The DARPA SCORE program (which I&#39;ve written about before) had two separate components for prediction, one market-based (Replication Markets) and another which used a structured group discussion format to arrive at estimates (RepliCATS). The results aren&#39;t out yet, but my understanding is that RepliCATS outperformed the markets.</p><p>Personally, I find the shift from open markets and various fancy scoring and incentive mechanisms to &quot;put a handful of smart dudes in a room and ask them questions&quot; a bit disappointing. Why did we even need the markets and forecasting platforms in the first place? To identify the smart dudes, of course—but is that all there is to it? As the top forecasters abandon markets and start competing against them, they are (in a way) pulling up the ladder behind them. We need the public tournaments to identify the talent in the first place, but if the money just goes straight into Samotsvety&#39;s pockets instead of open tournaments, new people can&#39;t join the ecosystem any more. Where is the next Samotsvety going to come from? Part of the problem is that there&#39;s a positive externality to identifying forecasting talent and it&#39;s difficult to capture that value, so we end up with a bit of a market failure.</p><p>Perhaps the only way to make markets competitive is to make them lucrative enough that it&#39;s worthwhile to form hedge fund-like teams which can generate <em>internal</em> benefits from information-sharing and deploy those onto the market, with the added benefit of honing them through competition. But that seems unlikely at the moment, the money just isn&#39;t there.</p><p>In one of the possible worlds ahead of us, the endpoint of this process will be the re-creation of the consulting firm—except for real this time. With the right kind of marketing angle I could easily see Samotsvety becoming a kind of 21st century McKinsey for the hip SV crowd that wants to signal that it needs <em>actual</em> advice rather than political cover. Could the forecasters avoid the pitfalls of the consultancy world?</p><p>What are the limits to forecasting accuracy? Eli Lifland <a href="https://www.foxy-scout.com/retro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is skeptical</a> about the possibility of improving his abilities, but I&#39;m not sure I buy that line entirely. We&#39;re still very early on, and many obvious low-hanging fruits have yet to be tried. If the forecasting-group-as-consultancy takes off, I would expect to see many serious attempts at improvement, starting with things like teaching domain experts forecasting and then putting them in close collaboration with top-tier generalists and forecasters.</p><p>What worries me is that this is a movement away from objective scoring and back towards reputation-based systems of trust. Once you leave the world of open markets and platforms, you become disconnected from their inescapable, public, and powerful error-correcting mechanisms—weak arguments can once again be laundered in the dirty soapwater of prominence and influence. Perhaps the current crop of top forecasters have the integrity to avoid going down that path, but how can that be maintained in the long run, with a powerful headwind of incentives and entryism blowing against us?</p><div class="subscribediv" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:250px;margin-top:30px"><form class="validate" action="https://fantasticanachronism.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=2a6ff66ec7039625cb12680d5&amp;amp;id=f713c1306c" method="post" id="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" target="_blank"><div class="mc-field-group"><input class="required email" type="email" name="EMAIL" id="mce-EMAIL" placeholder="Type your email..."></div><div class="clear" id="mce-responses"><div class="respose" id="mce-error-response" style="display:none"></div><div class="respose" id="mce-success-response" style="display:none"></div></div><div style="position:absolute;left:-5000px" aria-hidden="true"><input type="text" name="b_2a6ff66ec7039625cb12680d5_f713c1306c" tabindex="-1"></div><div class="clear"><input type="submit" value="Subscribe" name="subscribe" id="mc-embedded-subscribe" clas="button"></div></form></div></div></div><br><hr class="postDivider"><br><div class="post"><h1 class="post-title"><a href="/2022/10/10/against-effective-altruism/">Against Effective Altruism</a></h1><div class="post-meta">2022-10-10</div><a class="disqus-comment-count" data-page-id="/2022/10/10/against-effective-altruism/" href="/2022/10/10/against-effective-altruism/#commento"></a><div class="post-content"><h1 id="From-Above-Metaethics"><a href="#From-Above-Metaethics" class="headerlink" title="From Above: Metaethics"></a>From Above: Metaethics</h1><p>You&#39;re (probably) all theological anti-realists; just apply the same reasoning to the existence of moral facts! If the magical invisible sky god is obviously fake, why do you accept magical invisible sky moral facts? Just take the standard &quot;rationalist&quot; toolkit, apply it to realism, and it disappears in a puff of smoke. The arguments can just be copy pasted: for example, one of the classic (and most powerful) arguments from the New Atheism internet wars was that theists are really atheists about every god except their own. The moral realist is an anti-realist about all moral claims except the ones he happens to like! What is the base rate of moral truth, and why do you believe your inside view is enough to overcome that?</p><p>Realist arguments always come across as utterly absurd because their task is 1) extremely simple and obvious, and 2) impossible. All they have to do is say &quot;we used methods x, y, z to uncover moral facts a, b, c, and you can replicate the procedure independently to verify our results&quot;. But it&#39;s never like that, it&#39;s always some interminable verbcel nonsense to cover up the fact that they don&#39;t actually have any access to the moral facts that their theory says they <em>should</em> have access to!</p><p>Whenever I hear the word &quot;intuition&quot; out of the mouth of a philosopher I reach for my Browning!<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn10280584171" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref10280584171">1</sup></a></span></p><p>It comes down to this:</p><ul><li>Naturalism: no evidence</li><li>Non-naturalism: magic</li></ul><p>Often they&#39;ll back off and come up with excuses about why moral facts aren&#39;t accessible in that way, but that just wrecks the whole thing. Even if realism <em>is</em> true, if there&#39;s no reliable empirical access to moral facts, then that&#39;s functionally equivalent to anti-realism. Any defense based on the immunity of moral propositions to empirical investigation also makes it impossible to find the truth. Your metaethics either has to have a way to determine what&#39;s true in ethics, or you&#39;re practically a nihilist.</p><p>Traditionally the problem has been solved with an appeal to God but EAs are, to a first approximation, 100% atheist. You can&#39;t pull an <em>Euthyphro</em> any more, so WHAT&#39;S YOUR MORAL EPISTEMOLOGY MOTHERFUCKER? Why do epistemic standards seem to suddenly disappear when it comes to utilitarianism? Why am I constantly being asked to believe in the existence of these ontologically redundant entities?</p><p>The <em>theologians</em> at least have the decency to offer <em>some</em> kind of story: ask them about the origin of God and they might invoke the cosmological argument or the principle of sufficient reason. Ask a <em>moralogian</em> about the origin of moral facts and all you&#39;ll get in return is a stupefied bovine expression. The <em>theologians</em> can <em>at least</em> appeal to miracles. The <em>moralogians</em> appeal to <em>nothing</em> and expect you to accept it! Is the origin of moral facts natural, or supernatural? If natural, can we engineer our own? Why or why not? The universe, fundamentally, is dumb. You are positing the existence of entities that are very much not dumb. Where the hell did they come from?</p><p>Above all the <em>moralogian</em> is conspicuously shameless. Even in the 13th century, a man like Aquinas (who would not meet a single doubter in his entire life) felt it necessary to justify his faith and present arguments in favor of the existence of God. Today&#39;s moralogian on the other hand feels no such compulsion, although he is beset on all sides by skeptics! The EA.org <a href="https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/metaethics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">page on meta-ethics</a> speaks for itself:</p><img src="/images/ea_metaethics-2d336ac89426625e4aeb100c0088e407.png"><p>Is this an excess of certainty, or is it because deep down the moralogian knows he has no real arguments?</p><p>And the moralogians are not stuck in airy castles of thought, they operate in the real world. The neoconservatives, for example, are a showcase of what happens when the moralogian takes hold of the reins of foreign policy—and it is a consistent ideology that genuinely seeks to spread the values it values. Buckhardt wrote that the foreign policy of Italian states of the Renaissance, free as it was from &quot;moral scruples&quot;, gave him &quot;the impression of a bottomless abyss&quot;. But who today could not prefer that naked self-interest to the neocon disaster of democracy and human rights? The effective altruists have yet to screw up that badly, but just look at the people who want to eliminate all wildlife and you have a good preview of what is possible—&quot;<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/10177384-man-your-head-is-haunted-you-have-wheels-in-your" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Man, your head is haunted!</a>&quot;</p><p>Peter Singer offers one of the most memorable instances of intellectual cowardice in the entire history of philosophy. Like any reasonable person, he used to be an anti-realist. Then he read Parfit and realized that anti-realism meant utilitarianism was not the case (not sure why it took Parfit to point that out to him). Instead of abandoning utilitarianism, he became a realist just to salvage his ideology! Pathetic.</p><p>Hilariously, Parfit later abandoned realism for what he calls &quot;non-realist cognitivism&quot;, which is basically the Sam Harris view except with bigger words.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn10280584172" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref10280584172">2</sup></a></span> Part 7 of vol. 3 of <em>On What Matters</em> is an incredible trainwreck, worth skimming just to see what kind of pretzel shapes people will contort themselves into in order to avoid accepting the obvious.

What does it mean for altruism to be &quot;effective&quot;? EAs take it for granted that the most effective altruism is the altruism that helps its <em>targets</em> the most. I would argue that altruism is really meant to help the altru<em>ist</em>, not the altru<em>ee</em>. That&#39;s the only way it could have evolved. So here&#39;s my pitch to you: effective altruism is the altruism that raises your status the most. The conspicuous lack of caring about the &quot;effectiveness&quot; of altruism among normal people is a hint! <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/11/arts/music/metropolitan-operas-donations-hit-a-record-182-million.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hundreds of millions per year for the NY Metropolitan Opera?</a> Sure, why not!

Thus we get Triversian self-deception where the altruist &quot;really means it&quot; (but of course if he really meant it he wouldn&#39;t be giving 10%). So <em>Actual</em> Effective Altruism is simply too gauche to exist.

This is all perfectly alright, you see.&quot; Sure, we&#39;re adaptation executors, but that doesn&#39;t give you a blank check to execute whatever retarded adaptation was bred into your hairy great-....great-grandfather 500,000 years ago, and is now <a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2020/03/03/memetic-defoundation/">incompatible with the world you live in</a> (or worse, become enslaved to &quot;unjustified crystallizations&quot; and meticulously engineered hyperstimuli designed to abuse your adaptations).

Given the rapid shift in our environment it&#39;s unsurprising that there are maladaptations in our system; but we can recognize and avoid them. Your &quot;adaptation execution&quot; has been memetically hijacked—where once you would get good things in return for your &quot;altruism&quot; (a stronger community, status, reciprocal altruism, coalition-building, or even &quot;niceness, community, and civilization&quot;), a runaway meme has now convinced you that it&#39;s actually better to get <em>nothing</em>!<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn10280584175" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref10280584175">5</sup></a></span> You get all the costs of religion, and none of the prosocial benefits!

When I look at effective altruists, all I see is overgrown antlers pulling them to the ground.</p><p>The absurdity is heightened because we <em>obviously know where these tendencies come from</em>, regardless of what philosophers try to imagine. We know where the evolved desire to gobble up an entire cake comes from—as you resist the clarion call of the chocolate cake, so you must also resist the call of &quot;effective&quot; altruism. A serious valuing of values can only begin when this baggage is dispensed with and laughed at.</p><h1 id="Fin"><a href="#Fin" class="headerlink" title="Fin"></a>Fin</h1><p>There are plenty of arguments against utilitarianism&#39;s internal logic: problems with interpersonal comparisons, aggregation, second-order effects, negative utility, average utility, discounting, etc. Whether you go negative, average, rule, or <em>fluorescent</em> there are tons of inescapable and fatal flaws.

But the New Atheists certainly didn&#39;t help. Extrapolating this line of reasoning is left as an exercise to the reader.</p><p>Are there values which are not merely instrumental?

Split into 257 short chapters, it blends a straightfoward and minimally fictionalized retelling of Operation Anthropoid (the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich) with all sorts of metafictional elements, as Binet constantly comments on the issues with constructing a historical novel, compares his approach to other books and movies, and even brings his personal life into it. Irony, humor, self-consciousness (especially about the author&#39;s view of Heydrich), the tension between history and fiction, and a slow, horrific build-up that absolutely fills you with terror. Strange how powerful emotionally a book that is at the same time so detached can be. Quite good and very different.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Man-Who-Loved-Only-Numbers/dp/0786884061?crid=30PLW4QLCRWDA&keywords=The+Man+Who+Loved+Only+Numbers&qid=1665069512&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIwLjI4IiwicXNhIjoiMC4yNCIsInFzcCI6IjAuMzIifQ%3D%3D&s=books&sprefix=the+man+who+loved+only+numbers%2Cstripbooks%2C340&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=4e197068f0851d6b2ab8b1dcefcdcdd5&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Man Who Loved Only Numbers: The Story of Paul Erdős and the Search for Mathematical Truth</a></strong> by Paul Hoffman.

Carroll. A curious artifact from a different era. Perfectly captures the zeitgeist of the peak of internet atheism and creationism debates. One could make statements about human evolution then which would be quite dangerous today. The stuff on DNA and evolution is pretty wide and not that deep. All of it has been covered better elsewhere. There&#39;s a chapter on EvoDevo for example, but it stays on the surface of things and I would recommend reading <em>Endless Forms Most Beautiful</em> (by the same author!) instead. On top of the evolution stuff you also have a random sprinkling of skeptic-related causes (dull and cringey rants about chiropractors), plus a very generic liberal environmentalism which basically ignores everything the author had written up to that point. Probably more interesting as a marker of a (short, but memorable) era than a book about DNA and evolution.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Moon-Sixpence-W-Somerset-Maugham/dp/1420951920?crid=16UV8LV22D3JX&keywords=the+moon+and+sixpence+maugham&qid=1665069460&refresh=1&s=books&sprefix=the+moon+and+sixpence+maugh%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C189&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=90e8462720590f04aee4066966d9ef4d&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Moon and Sixpence</a></strong> by Somerset W. Maugham. A fictionalized retelling of the life of Paul Gaugin, as a middle-aged English man abandons his family to go be a painter in Paris (and eventually Tahiti). I wasn&#39;t convinced by the central character, and there&#39;s nothing to this novel beyond him. The &quot;egotistic, single-minded genius&quot; trope has been done much better elsewhere, and the novel really strays very far from the actual life of Gaugin.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Golden-Bowl-Penguin-Classics/dp/0141441275?crid=3HSYOVV9PVF58&keywords=The+Golden+Bowl&qid=1665069486&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIzLjQ5IiwicXNhIjoiMy4xMSIsInFzcCI6IjMuMTAifQ%3D%3D&s=books&sprefix=the+golden+bowl%2Cstripbooks%2C519&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=159de31c121822be325f8304677b23e9&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Golden Bowl</a></strong> by Henry James.

An unstructured mishmash of warmed-over pop science and a cavalcade of bad arguments around abduction, philosophy of science, intelligence, infinity, qualia, etc. The arguments<br>about superhuman general intelligence not being possible because humans are universal Turing machines are utterly absurd and could be added verbatim to &quot;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10987" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On the Impossibility of Supersized Machines</a>&quot;. One of the worst treatments of abduction in the history of philosophy, and that&#39;s really saying something. Deutsch&#39;s comments on heritability are downright idiotic, and it&#39;s clear that he didn&#39;t even bother spending 30 seconds reading the wikipedia page. He just makes stuff up (incorrectly). A lot of uppity commentary about shit he doesn&#39;t understand. And then it&#39;s just filled with a whole bunch of random shit, like a galaxybrained theory of why the UK has the best voting system, a terrible theory of aesthetics, etc.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Man-Who-Loved-Only-Numbers/dp/0786884061?crid=30PLW4QLCRWDA&keywords=The+Man+Who+Loved+Only+Numbers&qid=1665069512&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIwLjI4IiwicXNhIjoiMC4yNCIsInFzcCI6IjAuMzIifQ%3D%3D&s=books&sprefix=the+man+who+loved+only+numbers%2Cstripbooks%2C340&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=4e197068f0851d6b2ab8b1dcefcdcdd5&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">First Light</a></strong> by Geoffrey Wellum.

A standard tale of a British explorer somehow making himself accepted and comfortable among the primitive natives (look up Thesiger&#39;s pics), and bemoaning the disappearance of their way of life. This particular one, among the pastoral tribes of the marshes of southern Iraq. Perhaps what makes it unique is that it is set not in the 19th century, but in the late 1950s. Comfy but unexceptional, ultimately the Madan are just not that interesting.</p><div class="subscribediv" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:250px;margin-top:30px"><form class="validate"
