Newstok. A Romantic old-man-yells-at-clouds tirade about modern education practices. It didn&#39;t change any of my views, but it didn&#39;t really attempt to do so in the first place: Newstok is a reformist, while I am strictly an abolitionist—and therefore far outside the target audience. I find it hard to separate mass education from the commoditization of knowledge, while Newstok believes we can have our cake and eat it too. In any case, if you want a passionate argument in favor of high-quality education interspersed with Shakespeare quotes, this is the book for you.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Frank-Herberts-Dune-3-Book-Boxed/dp/0593201892?crid=3U4MMQO42NODF&keywords=dune+herbert&qid=1649063077&sprefix=dune+he%2Caps%2C317&sr=8-3&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=0d077bc42ee5ecc5eb58e4cf6902769e&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dune</a></strong>, by Frank Herbert. Pretty great, Herbert constructs a deeply alluring world which pulls you in despite some rather hilariously implausible aspects. It&#39;s interesting how so much of the &quot;plot&quot; actually happens in the background. The audiobook is quite good.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Frank-Herberts-Dune-3-Book-Boxed/dp/0593201892?crid=3U4MMQO42NODF&keywords=dune+herbert&qid=1649063077&sprefix=dune+he%2Caps%2C317&sr=8-3&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=0d077bc42ee5ecc5eb58e4cf6902769e&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dune Messiah</a></strong>, by Frank Herbert. I was told the sequels get crazy, and this is a pretty good start in that direction! Can&#39;t wait to see where this nonsense ends up. This is basically a book of palace intrigue and scheming, with a rich religious/predestination/weird time loop sauce on top.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Star-Maker-Olaf-Stapledon/dp/0486466833?crid=1YV5UG2XWKK7U&keywords=star+maker&qid=1649063124&sprefix=star%2Caps%2C941&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=1ee0aedc2c6127e7caf250f857164658&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Star Maker</a></strong>, by Olaf Stapledon. I kept thinking that it felt like a really weird throwback to the 1920s-30s, then I looked it up and it was written in 1937. Whoops. It&#39;s a non-stop torrent of interesting science fiction ideas, but there&#39;s no continuity, no characters to latch on to, and the examination of the ideas stays at the surface level. It&#39;s just a series of &quot;this happened, then this happened, then this happened&quot; which I found rather boring.</li><li><strong><a href>The Island of Doctor Death and Other Stories and Other Stories</a></strong>, by Gene Wolfe. Some fantastic stories in this collection, in particular I loved Feather Tigers, Death of Dr. Island, Toy Theater, and Seven American Nights. Many of them are in that classic Wolfe style where you have to piece together what&#39;s going on from tiny hints left in the text, and it&#39;s all a bit ambiguous in the end and so on. There&#39;s a lot of focus on religion and death (with two stories, <em>The Hero as Werwolf</em> and <em>The Doctor of Death Island</em>, being fairly explicitly death-ist).</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Orphans-Sky-Robert-Heinlein/dp/0671318454?crid=188W5DP34R9LB&keywords=orphans+of+the+sky&qid=1649063511&sprefix=orphans+of+the+s%2Caps%2C234&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=a8feb1e2dba52cbe188fbee2263df408&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Orphans of the Sky</a></strong>, by Robert Heinlein. Fairly standard generation ship story. Juvenile and ham-fisted (there&#39;s a scene where the protagonist literally yells out &quot;and yet it moves!&quot;). Mutants and knife fights and all that. 12 year old me would&#39;ve loved it.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wittgensteins-Nephew-Novel-Vintage-International/dp/1400077567?keywords=Wittgenstein%27s+Nephew&qid=1649063536&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=525837e06e74e8fca7b0c3fac02b6702&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wittgenstein&#39;s Nephew</a></strong>, by Thomas Bernhard. Bernhard documents his friendship with Paul Wittgenstein (not the pianist), a black sheep of the Wittgenstein family who suffered from various mental problems. They&#39;re both rejected by Austrian society, and they both reject it. Bernhard&#39;s attitude toward awards (he views them as a kind of insult and punishment) really sums up his relation to his country. A bitter book, rather sad and pathetic and miserly. Recommended if you&#39;re in the market for a feel-bad memoir.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Status-Game-Human-Life-Play/dp/0008354677?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1649063638&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=1e79a2cc8525d392bb7e1bee453a5e01&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Status Game: On Social Position and How We Use It</a></strong>, by Will Storr. There&#39;s quite a bit of overlap with <em>The Elephant in the Brain</em>, but Storr&#39;s book is obviously more focused on status. Also reminiscent of Goffman&#39;s <em>Presentation of Self in Everyday Life</em>. Lots of references to Boehm, Henrich, Kuran, Wrangham, etc. (You&#39;re probably better off going straight to the source?) If I had to choose between this and <em>Elephant</em> I&#39;d go for <em>Elephant</em>, but they&#39;re fairly complementary so it won&#39;t be a waste of your time to read both. Parts of the book are focused on contemporary culture war issues, which felt a bit shallow and tiresome.

Battutah was born in Morocco; he was not wealthy, but he was well-educated and went into the family business of Islamic law. At age 21, he set out for the pilgrimage to Mecca. He would extend his journey for decades, however, following traders in ships and caravans, relying on generous Muslim institutions and his talent for befriending rulers. He eventually covered virtually the entire Islamic world and beyond, from North Africa to China.</p><p>Battutah gets into all sorts of adventures (luckily escaping death by disease, shipwreck, pirates, bandits, and so on) and provides us with some incredible ethnographic observations. In Constantinople, he meets the Emperor. In India, he becomes a prominent and wealthy administrator under the rule of an erratic Sultan. In the Maldives, he marries six local women and lives a life of leisure under the shade of the palm trees. Yet his wanderlust compels him to keep moving. Battutah himself as a person, however, remains tantalizingly obscure.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Having divorced my wives I set sail. We came to a little island in the archipelago in which there was but one house, occupied by a weaver. He had a wife and family, a few coco-palms and a small boat, with which he used to fish and to cross over to any of the islands he wished to visit. His island contained also banana bushes, but we saw no land birds on it except two crows, which came out to us on our arrival and circled above our vessel. And I swear I envied that man, and wished that the island had been mine, that I might have made it my retreat until the inevitable hour should befall me.</p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="/images/bb21_libra-18e06a316bc03c753d3c8ce97bf7bc59.jpg" class="floatright nofancybox"><p>Don DeLillo, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Libra-Contemporary-American-Fiction-DeLillo/dp/0140156046?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1642242862&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=ab64c1da21e6e03ca9ee8abd68d744f3&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Libra</strong></a></p><p>A semi-fictionalized biography of Lee Harvey Oswald in the Oliver Stone tradition, suffused with that great DeLillo style.

It&#39;s quite Pynchonesque with all the criss-crossing conspiracies, the CIA, paranoia, axes of control and influence, a series of coincidences, taking liberty with history...and the ultimately mysterious &quot;fate&quot; that brought Oswald to the assassination.

It comes out of dreams, visions, intuitions, prayers, out of the deepest levels of the self. It&#39;s not generated by cause and effect like the other two lines. It&#39;s a line that cuts across causality, cuts across time. It has no history that we can recognize or understand. But it forces a connection.

It&#39;s not just about the manuscripts themselves, but also who owned them, their condition, how they&#39;ve been maintained or altered, where they&#39;re housed, and the people taking care of them.

Both scribes 2 and 3 (let us exclude 1 for the moment) left simple rectangular blank spaces where large initials were to be painted later, without thought to their shape or composition, and they added guidewords in the margins to indicate what letters were to be supplied. When Hugo came to fill them in, his flamboyantly fluid and multi-tentacled initials fitted uncomfortably into these big draughty square apertures. However, during the stint written by the last scribe from folio 185v onwards, the edges of the script are moulded line by line to fit around the curves and limbs of the painted initials, nestling together snugly like a newly married couple in bed. Text and decoration must have been executed simultaneously by the same person.

Bhattacharya approaches his subject by focusing on ideas. The first chapter takes care of JvN&#39;s early life, and the rest of the book is split up based on the subjects he worked on: mathematics, quantum mechanics, the nuclear bomb, computing, game theory, RAND, and artificial life. Large parts of the book (I&#39;d say about a third) are dedicated not to von Neumann but rather the work other people did based on his ideas. The game theory chapter, for example, covers Nash, Schelling, Aumann, etc. in economics, and John Maynard Smith, Price, Hamilton, etc. in evolutionary game theory. Bhattacharya is good at making all these technical subjects accessible without dumbing them down too much. The one failing point is that JvN&#39;s personality, personal life, and professional relationships don&#39;t get much attention.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>From 1944, meetings instigated by Norbert Wiener helped to focus von Neumann’s thinking about brains and computers. In gatherings of the short-lived ‘Teleological Society’, and later in the ‘Conferences on Cybernetics’, von Neumann was at the heart of discussions on how the brain or computing machines generate ‘purposive behaviour’. Busy with so many other things, he would whizz in, lecture for an hour or two on the links between information and entropy or circuits for logical reasoning, then whizz off again – leaving the bewildered attendees to discuss the implications of whatever he had said for the rest of the afternoon. Listening to von Neumann talk about the logic of neuro-anatomy, one scientist declared, was like ‘hanging on to the tail of a kite’. Wiener, for his part, had the discomfiting habit of falling asleep during discussions and snoring loudly, only to wake with some pertinent comment demonstrating he had somehow been listening after all.</p></div></blockquote><div style="clear:both"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="/images/bb21_vasari-f54cb835de97b20d7df6e8f6276d29f0.jpg" class="floatleft nofancybox"><p>Giorgio Vasari, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Painters-Sculptors-Architects-Everymans-Library/dp/0679451013?crid=34EOH3UWSF89R&keywords=vasari+everyman&qid=1642354706&sprefix=vasari+everym%2Caps%2C186&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=36e39c73f8af38252faffcd29927e3d6&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>The Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects</strong></a></p><p>History by way of biography—Vasari tells a tale of rebirth and artistic progress as Europe emerges from the dark ages, rediscovers the ancients, and then strives to surpass them.

Five minutes he stayed there, fixed like a barb in the blue flesh of the sky.

He side-slipped to his left, paused, then glided round and down into what could only be the beginning of a tremendous stoop. There is no mistaking the menace of that first easy drifting fall. Smoothly, at an angle of fifty degrees, he descended; not slowly, but controlling his speed; gracefully, beautifully balanced. There was no abrupt change. The angle of his fall became gradually steeper till there was no angle left, but only a perfect arc. He curved over and slowly revolved, as though for delight, glorying in anticipation of the dive to come. His feet opened and gleamed golden, clutching up towards the sun. He rolled over, and they dulled, and turned towards the ground beneath, and closed again. For a thousand feet he fell, and curved, and slowly turned, and tilted upright. Then his speed increased, and he dropped vertically down. He had another thousand feet to fall, but now he fell sheer, shimmering down through dazzling sunlight, heart-shaped, like a heart in flames. He became smaller and darker, diving down from the sun. The partridge in the snow beneath looked up at the black heart dilating down upon him, and heard a hiss of wings rising to a roar. In ten seconds the hawk was down, and the whole splendid fabric, the arched reredos and immense fan-vaulting of his flight, was consumed and lost in the fiery maelstrom of the sky.</p><p>And for the partridge there was the sun suddenly shut out, the foul flailing blackness spreading wings above, the roar ceasing, the blazing knives driving in, the terrible white face descending, hooked and masked and horned and staring-eyed.

Douglas Adams wrote of a theory &quot;which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear&quot;. The modern world offers many such <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/11/the-phatic-and-the-anti-inductive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-inductive</a> cases, above all in the movements of the stock market: successful trading strategies tend to stop working after they become known. On a civilizational scale, Malthusianism became irrelevant right at the time someone was able to articulate the idea, and it seems that the moment we are able to improve ourselves through genetic engineering, we will be wiped out by our artificial creations.</p><p>A second type of ill-fated seeker is one who finds what he is looking for, but his goal is also a punishment. William Beckford, categorically rejecting Ulysses&#39; actions at the land of the Sirens (perhaps inspired by his own life, and perhaps commenting on all attempts to comprehend the universe) created the apostate Caliph Vathek whose obsessive quest for knowledge results in his damnation, and for whom Hell is both the object of desire and the punishment for that desire. There are those who argue that the libertine Beckford only adopted this biblical attitude against the Faustian spirit as an ironic orientalist façade, but the Caliph resists all attempts at interpretation.</p><p>Some seekers reach their goal, only to have it slip out of their hands. Scientists will occasionally chance on the right idea but lack the ability to prove it: Aristarchus of Samos was doomed by the apparent size of the stars and the lack of parallax. The Royal Navy discovered that lemons prevent scurvy, and then through terrible epistemic luck managed to <a href="https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2022/01/11/reality-is-very-weird-and-you-need-to-be-prepared-for-that/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lose that knowledge</a> over the course of the 19th century: lemons were replaced by limes low in vitamin C, but nobody noticed because the ships were faster. The problem only reappeared when polar explorers started suffering from scurvy despite bringing lime juice with them—and the answer was only discovered by the miraculously good luck of experimenting on guinea pigs, one of very few animals that don&#39;t produce vitamin C on their own.</p><p>Finally the most ironic case of them all, that of the Dalmatian archbishop and heretic Marco Antonio de Dominis: a seeker who is able to find the answer, but is condemned to believe it is false. De Dominis, a contemporary of Kepler (who wrote in favor of the lunar theory of tides) and Galileo (who mocked it), was also an amateur astronomer and wrote a book on the tides titled <em>Euripus</em>.</p><p>The archbishop begins by presenting both empirical and theoretical arguments in favor of the thesis that the earth is a sphere. He then describes the luni-solar theory of tides: he (correctly) writes that tides are caused by the combined gravitational action of the sun and the moon, (correctly) predicts that high tide occurs simultaneously at antipodal points, and (correctly) shows that the cycle of spring and neap tides can be explained by the combined action of the sun and moon. He also (correctly) deduces that the diurnal inequality between tides will be greatest when the moon is above the tropic of Cancer or Capricorn. Finally, de Dominis explains (incorrectly) that since the two daily tides are always equal to each other, the theory must be false. The heretical archbishop died behind the bars of the Castel Sant&#39;Angelo before his book could be published.</p><div class="subscribediv" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:250px;margin-top:30px"><form class="validate" action="https://fantasticanachronism.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=2a6ff66ec7039625cb12680d5&amp;amp;id=f713c1306c" method="post" id="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" target="_blank"><div class="mc-field-group"><input class="required email" type="email" name="EMAIL" id="mce-EMAIL" placeholder="Type your email..."></div><div class="clear" id="mce-responses"><div class="respose" id="mce-error-response" style="display:none"></div><div class="respose" id="mce-success-response" style="display:none"></div></div><div style="position:absolute;left:-5000px" aria-hidden="true"><input type="text" name="b_2a6ff66ec7039625cb12680d5_f713c1306c" tabindex="-1"></div><div class="clear"><input type="submit" value="Subscribe" name="subscribe" id="mc-embedded-subscribe" clas="button"></div></form></div></div></div><br><hr class="postDivider"><br><div class="post"><h1 class="post-title"><a href="/2022/01/04/links-and-what-ive-been-reading-q4-2021/">Links &amp; What I've Been Reading Q4 2021</a></h1><div class="post-meta">2022-01-04</div><a class="disqus-comment-count" data-page-id="/2022/01/04/links-and-what-ive-been-reading-q4-2021/" href="/2022/01/04/links-and-what-ive-been-reading-q4-2021/#commento"></a><div class="post-content"><h2 id="Links"><a href="#Links" class="headerlink" title="Links"></a>Links</h2><h3 id="Metascience"><a href="#Metascience" class="headerlink" title="Metascience"></a>Metascience</h3><p>1&#x2E; <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/71601" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Investigating the replicability of preclinical cancer biology</a>: &quot;50 experiments from 23 papers were repeated, generating data about the replicability of a total of 158 effects [...] for positive effects, the median effect size in the replications was 85% smaller than the median effect size in the original experiments&quot;</p><p>2&#x2E; <a href="https://steamtraen.blogspot.com/2021/10/a-catastrophic-failure-of-peer-review.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A catastrophic failure of peer review in obstetrics and gynaecology</a>: &quot;I estimate that across these 46 articles, 346 (64%) of the 542 parametric tests (unpaired <em>t</em> tests, or, occasionally, ANOVA) and 151 (61%) of the 247 contingency table test (Pearson&#39;s <em>Χ</em>² or Fisher&#39;s exact test) that I was able to check were incorrectly reported.&quot;</p><p>3&#x2E; <a href="https://markusstrasser.org/p/bcd8bded-7136-4bb4-8f97-e8a3a7b6d926/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Business of Extracting Knowledge from Academic Publications</a>: &quot;Close to nothing of what makes science actually work is published as text on the web.&quot;</p><p>4&#x2E; <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/44/e2103313118" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A large replication project in marketing</a>, with fairly catastrophic results.

Bhattacharya approaches his subject by focusing on ideas. The first chapter takes care of JvN&#39;s early life, and the rest of the book is split up based on the subjects he worked on: mathematics, quantum mechanics, the nuclear bomb, computing, game theory, RAND, and artificial life. Large parts of the book (I&#39;d say about a third) are dedicated not to von Neumann but rather the work other people did based on his ideas. The game theory chapter, for example, covers Nash, Schelling, Aumann, etc. in economics, and John Maynard Smith, Price, Hamilton, etc. in evolutionary game theory. Bhattacharya is good at making all these technical subjects accessible without dumbing them down too much. JvN&#39;s personality, personal life, professional relationships, etc. on the other hand are given scant attention.</p><p>Overall it felt a bit too short. In less than 300 pages we get such a wide array of ideas, and the story of how they influenced so many people, that it often feels like we&#39;re just skimming the surface in a speedboat.

Every round began with one week of surveys, followed by two weeks of market trading, and then a one week break. The studies were sourced from all social science disciplines (economics, psychology, sociology, management, etc.) and were published between 2009 and 2018 (in other words, most of the sample came from the post-replication crisis era).</p><p>Only a subset of the papers will be replicated: ~100 papers were selected for a full replication, and another ~150 for a &quot;data replication&quot; in which the same methodology is applied to a different (but pre-existing) dataset.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn19752923461" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref19752923461">1</sup></a></span> Out of the target 250 replications, only about 100 were completed by the time the prizes were paid out.</p><h2 id="Surveys"><a href="#Surveys" class="headerlink" title="Surveys"></a>Surveys</h2><p>The surveys included a link to the paper, a brief summary of the claim selected for replication, the methodology, and a few statistical values (sample size, effect size, test statistic values, p-value). We then had to answer three questions:</p><ol><li>What is the probability of the paper replicating?</li><li>What proportion of other forecasters do you think will answer &gt;50% to the first question?</li><li>How plausible is the claim in general?</li></ol><p>The papers were split up into batches of 10, and the top 4 scorers in each batch won awards of $80, $40, $20, and $20 for a total of $4,800 per survey round.</p><p>The exact scoring method was not revealed in order to prevent gaming the system, but after the competition ended <a href="https://www.replicationmarkets.com/index.php/2020/10/21/surrogate-scoring-rules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the organizers wrote a technical blog post explaining the &quot;surrogate scoring rule&quot; approach</a>. Since the replications were not completed yet, scoring predictions had to be done without reference to the &quot;ground truth&quot;; instead they generated a &quot;surrogate outcome&quot; based on all the survey answers and used that to score the predictions.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn19752923462" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref19752923462">2</sup></a></span></p><h2 id="Markets"><a href="#Markets" class="headerlink" title="Markets"></a>Markets</h2><p>Every user started each round with 1 point per claim (so typically 300).<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn19752923463" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref19752923463">3</sup></a></span> These points were the currency used to buy &quot;shares&quot; for every claim. Long share positions pay out if the paper replicates successfully and short positions pay out if it does not. Like a normal stock market, if you bought shares at a low price and the price went up, you could sell those shares for a profit.</p><p>The starting price of each claim was based on its p-value:</p><ul><li>p&lt;.05: 30%</li><li>p&lt;.01: 40%</li><li>p&lt;.001: 80%</li></ul><p>The market did not operate like a typical stock market (ie a continuous double auction); instead, they used Robin Hanson&#39;s <a href="http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/mktscore.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule</a> which allows users to trade without a counterparty.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn19752923464" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref19752923464">4</sup></a></span> Effectively it works as an automated market maker, making it costlier to trade the more extreme the price: taking a claim from 50% to 51% was cheap, while taking it from 98% to 99% was very expensive. Without any order book depth, prices could be rather volatile as it didn&#39;t take much for a single person to significantly shift the price on a claim; this also created profitable trading opportunities.</p><p>The payout for the markets was about $14k per round, awarded in proportion to winning shares in the papers selected for replication. Given the target of 250 replications, that means about 8% of the claims would actually resolve. The small number of actually completed replications, however, caused some issues: round 9, for example, only had 2 (out of the target 25) replications actually pay out.</p><h1 id="Early-Steps-A-Simple-Model"><a href="#Early-Steps-A-Simple-Model" class="headerlink" title="Early Steps - A Simple Model"></a>Early Steps - A Simple Model</h1><p>I didn&#39;t take the first round very seriously, and I had a horrible flu during the second round, so I only really started playing in round 3. I remembered Tetlock writing that &quot;it is impossible to find any domain in which humans clearly outperformed crude extrapolation algorithms, less still sophisticated statistical ones&quot;, so I decided to start with a statistical model to help me out.</p><p>This felt like a perfect occasion for a centaur approach (combining human judgment with a model), as there was plenty of quantitative data, but also lots of qualitative factors that are hard to model. For example, some papers with high p-values were nevertheless obviously going to replicate, due to how plausible the hypothesis was a priori.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn19752923465" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref19752923465">5</sup></a></span></p><p>Luckily someone had already collected the relevant data and built a model.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn19752923466" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref19752923466">6</sup></a></span> <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0225826" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Altmejd et al.

On top of that I wanted to limit the number of variables I would have to collect for every paper, as I had to do 300 of them in a week—any factors that would be cumbersome to look up (eg the job title of each author) were discarded. I also transformed a bunch of the variables, for example replacing raw citation counts with log citations per year.</p><p>I ended up going with a logistic ridge regression (shrinkage tends to help with out-of-sample predictions).

of authors, ratio male, and # of pages, these variables were not predictive of market prices in RM. Even the relation of citations to market prices was very weak. I think the market simply ignored any data it was not given directly, even if it was important. This gave me a bit of an edge, but also made evaluating the performance of the model more difficult as the market was systematically wrong in some ways.</p><p>Collecting the additional data needed for the model was fairly cumbersome: completing the surveys took ~140 seconds per paper when I was just doing it in my head, and ~210 seconds with the extra work of data entry.

I started by reading the summary of the study on the RM website (which included the abstract, a description of the selected claim, sample size, p-value, and effect size). After that I skimmed the paper itself. If I didn&#39;t understand the methodology I checked the methods and/or conclusions, but the vast majority of papers were just straight regressions, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ANOVA</a>s, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_equation_modeling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEM</a>s. The most important information was almost always in the table with the main statistical results.</p><p>The factors I took into account, in rough order of importance:</p><ul><li><strong>p-value</strong>. Try to find the actual p-value, they are often not reported. Many papers will just give stars for &lt;.05 and &lt;.01, but sometimes &lt;.01 means 0.0000001! There&#39;s a shocking number of papers that only report coefficients and asterisks—no SEs, no CIs, no t-stats.</li><li><strong>Power</strong>. Ideally you&#39;ll do a proper power analysis, but I just eyeballed it.</li><li><strong>Plausibility</strong>. This is the most subjective part of the judgment and it can make an enormous difference. Some broad guidelines:<ul><li>People respond to incentives.</li><li>Good things tend to be correlated with good things and negatively correlated with bad things.</li><li>Subtle interventions do not have huge effects.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Pre-registration</strong>. Huge plus. Ideally you want to check if the plan was actually followed.</li><li><strong>Interaction</strong> effect. They tend to be especially underpowered.</li><li><strong>Other research</strong> on the same/similar questions, tests, scales, methodologies—this can be difficult for non-specialists, but the track record of a theory or methodology is important. Beware publication bias.</li><li><strong>Methodology</strong> - RCT/RDD/DID good. IV depends, many are crap. Various natural-/quasi-experiments: some good, some bad (often hard to replicate). Lab experiments, neutral. Approaches that don&#39;t deal with causal identification depend heavily on prior plausibility.</li><li><strong>Robustness</strong> checks: how does the claim hold up across specifications, samples, experiments, etc.</li><li>Signs of a <strong>fishing expedition/researcher degrees of freedom</strong>. If you see a gazillion potential outcome variables and that they picked the one that happened to have p&lt;0.05, that&#39;s what we in the business call a &quot;red flag&quot;. Look out for stuff like ad hoc quadratic terms.</li><li><strong>Suspiciously transformed variables</strong>. Continuous variables put into arbitrary bins are a classic p-hacking technique.</li><li><strong>General propensity for error</strong>/inconsistency in measurements. Fluffy variables or experiments involving wrangling 9 month old babies, for example.</li></ul><p>Things that don&#39;t matter for replication but matter very much in the real world:</p><ul><li>Causal identification! The plausibility of a paper&#39;s causal identification strategy is generally orthogonal to its chances of replicating.</li><li>Generalizability. Lab experiments are replicated in other labs.</li></ul><p>Some papers were completely outside my understanding, and I didn&#39;t spend any time trying to understand them. Jargon-heavy cognitive science papers often fell into this category. I just gave a forecast close to the default and marked them as &quot;low confidence&quot; in my notes, then avoided trading them during the market round. On the other hand, sometimes I got the feeling that the jargon was just there to cover up bullshit (leadership studies, I&#39;m looking at you) in which case I docked points for stuff I didn&#39;t understand. The epistemological problem of how to determine which jargon is legit and which is not, is left as an exercise to the reader.</p><h2 id="Pour-exemple"><a href="#Pour-exemple" class="headerlink" title="Pour exemple"></a>Pour exemple</h2><p>The data from Replication Markets are still embargoed, so I can&#39;t give you any real examples. Instead, I have selected a couple of papers that were not part of the project but are similar enough.</p><h3 id="Ex-1-Criminology"><a href="#Ex-1-Criminology" class="headerlink" title="Ex. 1: Criminology"></a><strong>Ex. 1: Criminology</strong></h3><p>My first example is a criminology paper which purports to investigate the effect of parenting styles on criminal offending. Despite using causal language throughout, the paper has no causal identification strategy whatsoever. If criminologists had better GRE scores this nonsense would never have been published. The most relevant bits of the abstract:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>The present study used path analyses and prospective, longitudinal data from a sample of 318 African American men to examine the effects of eight parenting styles on adult crime. Furthermore, we investigated the extent to which significant parenting effects are mediated by criminogenic schemas, negative emotions, peer affiliations, adult transitions, and involvement with the criminal justice system. Consonant with the study hypotheses, the results indicated that [...] parenting styles low on demandingness but high on responsiveness or corporal punishment were associated with a robust increase in risk for adult crime.</p></div></blockquote><p>The selected claim is the effect of abusive parenting (the &quot;abusive&quot; parenting style involves &quot;high corporal punishment&quot; but low &quot;demandingness&quot; and &quot;responsiveness&quot;) on offending; I have highlighted the outcome in the main regression table below. While the asterisks only say p&lt;.01, the text below indicates that the p-value is actually &lt;.001.</p><p>Make your own guess about the probability of replication and then scroll down to mine below.</p><img src="/images/howwon_criminologyabusive-de98f273ea58dded1d94c11bde4d6021.png"><p>I&#39;d give this claim 78%. The results are obviously confounded, but they&#39;re confounded in a way that is fairly intuitive, and we would expect the replication to be confounded in the exact same way. Abusive parents are clearly more likely to have kids who become criminals. Although they don&#39;t give us the exact t-stat, the p-value is very low. On the negative side the sample size (318 people spread over 8 different parenting styles) isn&#39;t that big, I&#39;m a bit worried about variance in the classification of parenting styles, and there&#39;s a chance that the (non-causal) relation between abusive parenting and offending could be lost in the controls.</p><p>This is a classic example of &quot;just because it replicates doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s good&quot;, and also a prime example of why the entire field of criminology should be scrapped.</p><h3 id="Ex-2-Environmental-Psychology"><a href="#Ex-2-Environmental-Psychology" class="headerlink" title="Ex. 2: Environmental Psychology"></a><strong>Ex. 2: Environmental Psychology</strong></h3><p>My second example is an &quot;environmental psychology&quot; paper about collective guilt and how people act in response to global warming.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>The present research examines whether collective guilt for an ingroup’s collective greenhouse gas emissions mediates the effects of beliefs about the causes and effects of global warming on willingness to engage in mitigation behavior.</p></div></blockquote><p>N=72 people responded to a survey after a manipulation, on a) the causes and b) the importance of the effects of climate change. The selected claim is that &quot;participants in the <em>human cause-minor effect</em> condition reported more collective guilt than did participants in the other three conditions (b* = .50, p &lt;.05)&quot;. Again, make your own guess before scrolling down.</p><img src="/images/howwon_climatechange-7a9e1fed2c7f11bea7e8fdf6777e0314.png"><p>I&#39;d go with 23% on this one. Large p-value, interaction effect, relatively small sample, and a result that does not seem all that plausible a priori. The lack of significance on the Cause/Effect parameters alone is also suspicious, as is the lack of signifiance on mitigation intentions. Lots of opportunities to find <em>some</em> significant effect here!</p><h1 id="Spreadsheets"><a href="#Spreadsheets" class="headerlink" title="Spreadsheets"></a>Spreadsheets</h1><p>The worst part of Replication Markets was the user interface: it did not offer any way to keep track of one&#39;s survey answers, so in order to effectively navigate the market rounds I had to manually keep track of all the predictions. There was also no way to track changes in the value of one&#39;s shares, so again that had to be done manually in order to exit successful trades and find new opportunities. The initial solution was giant spreadsheets:</p><img src="/images/howwon_predictionmarkets_studies-33b920d0e186672848f59163718ac2fb.png"><p>Since the initial prices were set depending on the claim&#39;s p-value, I knew ahead of time which claims would be most mispriced at the start of trading (and that&#39;s where the greatest opportunities were). So a second spreadsheet was used to track the best initial trades.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn197529234611" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref197529234611">11</sup></a></span> The final column tracks how those trades worked out by the end of the market round; as you can see not all of them were successful (including some significant &quot;overshoots&quot;), but in general I had a good hit rate. As you can see, there were far more &quot;longs&quot; than &quot;shorts&quot; at the start: these were mostly results that were highly plausible a priori but had failed to get a p-value below 0.001.</p><img src="/images/howwon_prep-59a83090477dbedee4bbef313da46f22.png"><p><em>[&quot;Final&quot; is my estimate, &quot;default&quot; is the starting price, &quot;mkt&quot; is the final market price]</em></p><p>Finally, a third spreadsheet was used to track live trading during the market rounds. There was no clean way of getting the prices from the RM website to my sheet, so I copy/pasted everything, parsed it, and then inserted the values into the sheet. I usually did that a few times per day (more often at the start, since that was where most trading activity was concentrated). The claims were then ranked by the difference between my own estimate and the market. My current share positions were listed next to them so I knew what I needed to trade. The &quot;Change&quot; column listed the change in price since the last update, so I could easily spot big changes (which usually meant new trading opportunities).</p><img src="/images/howwon_spreadheet-0dabf8aa42dec2966311684bb7d24ca2.png"><p><em>[&quot;Live&quot; is the current market price, &quot;My&quot; is my estimate, &quot;Shares&quot; is the current position]</em></p><h1 id="Forget-the-Model"><a href="#Forget-the-Model" class="headerlink" title="Forget the Model!"></a>Forget the Model!</h1><p>After the third round I took a look at the data to evaluate the model and there were two main problems:</p><ul><li>My own errors (prediction minus market price) were very similar with the errors of the model:</li></ul><img src="/images/howwon_memodelerrors-903289e24ad92f51f6779eb7cb160f83.png"><ul><li>The model failed badly at high-probability claims, and failed to improve overall performance.

But market prices were the only guide I had to go by (we didn&#39;t even get feedback on survey performance), and I believed the market was right and the model was wrong when it came to low-p-value claims.</p><p>What would happen if everyone tried to optimize for predicting market prices? I imagine we could have gotten into weird feedback loops, causing serious disconnects between market prices and actual replication probability. In practice I don&#39;t think that was an issue though.</p><p>If I had kept going with the model, I had some improvements in mind:</p><ul><li>Add some sort of non-linear p-value term (or go with z-scores instead).</li><li>Quantify my subjective judgment of &quot;plausibility&quot; and add it as another variable in the model.</li><li>Use the round 3 market data of 300 papers (possibly with extremized prices) to estimate a new model, which would more than triple my N from the original 131 papers. But I wasn&#39;t sure how to combine categorical data from the previous replications and probabilities from the prices in a single model.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn197529234612" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref197529234612">12</sup></a></span></li></ul><p>At this point it didn&#39;t seem worth the effort, especially given all the extra data collection work involved. So, from round 4 onward I abandoned the model completely and relied only on my own guesses.</p><h1 id="Playing-the-Game"><a href="#Playing-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="Playing the Game"></a>Playing the Game</h1><p>Two basic facts dictated the trading strategy:</p><ol><li>Only a small % of claims will actually be replicated and pay out.</li><li>Most claims are approximately correctly priced.</li></ol><p>It follows that smart traders make many trades, move the price by a small amount (the larger your trade the larger the price impact), and have a diversified portfolio. The inverse of this rule can be used to identify bad traders: anyone moving the price by a huge amount and concentrating their portfolio in a small number of bets is almost certainly a bad trader, and one can profitably fade their trades.</p><p>Another source of profitable trades was the start of the round. Many claims were highly mispriced, but making a profit depended on getting to them first, which was not always easy since everyone more or less wanted to make the same trades. Beyond that, I focused on simply allocating most of my points toward the most-mispriced claims.</p><p>I split the trading rounds into two phases:</p><ol><li><p>Trading based on the expected price movement.</p></li><li><p>At the very end of the round, trading based on my actual estimate of replication probability.</p></li></ol><p>Usually these two aspects would coincide, but there were certain types of claims that I believed were systematically mispriced by other market participants.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn197529234613" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref197529234613">13</sup></a></span> Trading those in the hope of making profits during the market round didn&#39;t work out, so I only allocated points toward them at the end.</p><p>Another factor to take into consideration was that not all claims were equally likely to be selected for replication. In some cases it was pretty obvious that a paper would be difficult or impossible to replicate directly. I was happy to trade them, but by the end of the round I excluded them from the portfolio.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn197529234614" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref197529234614">14</sup></a></span></p><p>Buying the most mispriced items also means you&#39;re stuck with a somewhat contrarian portfolio, which can be dangerous if you&#39;re wrong. Given the flat payout structure of the market, following the herd was not necessarily a bad idea. Sometimes if a claim traded strongly against my own forecast, I would lower the weight assigned to it or even avoid it completely. Suppose you think a study has a 30% chance of replicating, and a liquid market insists it has a 70% chance—how do you revise your forecast?</p><h1 id="Reacting-to-Feedback"><a href="#Reacting-to-Feedback" class="headerlink" title="Reacting to Feedback"></a>Reacting to Feedback</h1><p>After every round I generated a bunch of graphs that were designed to help me understand the market and improve my own forecasts. This was complicated by the fact that there were no replication results—all I had to go by were the market prices, and they could be misleading.</p><p>Among other things, I compared means, standard deviations, and quartiles of my own predictions vs the market; looked at my means and RMSE grouped by p-value and discipline; plotted the distribution of forecasts, and error vs market price; etc.</p><p>One standard pattern of prediction markets is that extremizing the market prediction makes it better. Simplistically, you can think of the market price being determined by informed traders and uninformed/noise traders. The latter pull the price toward the middle, so the best prediction is going to be (on average) more extreme than the market&#39;s. This is made worse in the case of Replication Markets because of the LMSR algorithm which makes shares much more expensive the closer you get to 0 or 100%. So you can often improve on things by just extremizing the market forecast, and I always checked to see if my predictions were on the extremizing side vs the market.</p><p>Here you can see the density plots of my own vs the market forecasts, split up by p-value category. (The vertical line is the default starting price for each group.)</p><img src="/images/howwon_density-8549621e378729db73b60e0b5be51184.png"><p>And here&#39;s the same data in scatterplot form:</p><img src="/images/howwon_mevsmarketscatter-984d1153fe8773dab7160a550116a9c0.png" title="My predictions vs the market." alt="My predictions vs the market."><span class="image-caption">My predictions vs the market.</span> <img src="/images/howwon_disdiffs-4593ff3b790ca418aefe8d7e166796c8.png" title="Difference between my forecasts and the market, by discipline." alt="Difference between my forecasts and the market, by discipline.

Perhaps I was influenced by the market and subtly changed my predictions based on what I saw. Did that make me more accurate or less? It&#39;s unclear, and based on the limited number of actual replication results it&#39;s impossible to tell. Another possibility is that the changing composition of forecasters over time made <em>the market</em> more similar to me?</p><img src="/images/howwon_rmsebyround-1f757e4ea180dba875ec2d8f065dd6d5.png"><h1 id="Automated-Trading"><a href="#Automated-Trading" class="headerlink" title="Automated Trading"></a>Automated Trading</h1><p>I think a lot of my success was due to putting in more effort than others were willing to. And by &quot;putting in effort&quot; I mean automating it so I don&#39;t have to put in any effort. In round 6 the trading API was introduced; at that point I dropped the spreadsheets and quickly threw together a desktop application (using C# &amp; WPF) that utilized the API and included both automated and manual trading.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn197529234615" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref197529234615">15</sup></a></span> Automating things also made more frequent data updates possible: instead of copy-pasting a giant webpage a few times a day, now everything updated automatically once every 15 minutes.</p><img src="/images/howwon_traderscreenshot-a2f3382ed91e19b7c3c39e0f43077018.png"><p>The main area on the left is the current state of the market and my portfolio, with papers sorted by how mispriced they are. <em>Mkt</em> is the current market price, <em>My</em> is my forecast, <em>Position</em> is the number of shares owned, <em>Liq. Value</em> is the number of points I could get by exiting this position, <em>WF</em> is a weight factor for the portfolio optimization, and <em>Hist</em> shows the price history of that claim.</p><p>On the right we have pending orders, a list of the latest orders executed on the market, plus logging on the bottom.</p><p>I used a simple weighting algorithm with a few heuristics sprinkled on top. Below you can see the settings for the weighting, plus a graph of the portfolio weights allocated by claim (the most-mispriced claims are on the left).</p><img src="/images/howwon_settings-33c8012f088c5279736980044a4f1673.png"><p>To start with I simply generated weights proportional to the square of the difference between the current market price and my target price (<em>Exponent</em>). Then,</p><ul><li>multiplied that by a per-study weight factor (<em>WF</em> in the main screen),</li><li>multiplied that by <em>ExtremeValueMultiplier</em> for claims with extreme prices (&lt;8% or &gt;96%),</li><li>removed any claims with a difference smaller than the <em>CutOff</em>,</li><li>removed any claims with weight below <em>MinThreshold</em>,</li><li>limited the maximum weight to <em>MaxPosition</em>,</li><li>and disallowed any trading for claims that were already close to their target weight (<em>NoWeightChangeBandwidth</em>).</li></ul><p>There was also another factor to take into consideration: the RM organizers ran some bots of their own. One simply traded randomly, while the other systematically moved prices back toward their default values. This created a predictable price pressure which had to be taken into account and potentially exploited: the <em>DefDiffPenalizationFactor</em> lowered the weight of claims that were expected to have adverse movements due to the bots.</p><p>Fading large price movements was automated, and I kept a certain amount of free points available so that I could take advantage of them quickly. Finally, turning the weighting algorithm into trades was fairly simple. If the free points fell below a threshold, the bot would automatically sell some shares. Most trades did not warrant a reaction however, and I had a semi-automated system for bringing the portfolio in line with the generated weights, which involved hitting a button to generate the orders and then firing them off.</p><h1 id="High-Frequency-Trading"><a href="#High-Frequency-Trading" class="headerlink" title="High Frequency Trading"></a>High Frequency Trading</h1><p>When there are a) obviously profitable trades to be made and b) multiple people competing for them, it&#39;s very easy to get into a competitive spiral that pushes speeds down to the minimum allowed by the available technology. That&#39;s how a replication prediction market ended up being all about shaving milliseconds off of trading algos.</p><p>By round 9 another player (named CPM) had also automated his trades and he was faster than me so he took all my profits by reacting to profitable opportunities before I could get my orders in—we were now locked in an HFT latency race. There was only one round left so I didn&#39;t want to spend too much time on it, but I did a small rewrite of my trading app so it could run on linux (thanks, .NET Core), which involved splitting it into a client (with the UI) and a server (with the trading logic), and patching in some networking so I could control it remotely.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn197529234616" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref197529234616">16</sup></a></span> Then, I threw it up on my VPS which had lower ping to the RM servers.</p><p>When I first ran my autotrader, I polled the API for new trades once every 15 minutes<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn197529234617" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref197529234617">17</sup></a></span>. Now it was a fight for milliseconds. Unfortunately placing the autotrader on the VPS wasn&#39;t enough, the latency was still fairly high and CPM crushed me again, though by a smaller margin this time. Sometimes I got lucky and snagged an opportunity before he could get to it though.</p><h1 id="The-Results"><a href="#The-Results" class="headerlink" title="The Results"></a>The Results</h1><p>In money terms, I made $6640 from the surveys and $4020 from the markets for a total of $10,660 (out of a total prizepool of about $190k).</p><p>In terms of the actual replication results, the detailed outcomes are still embargoed, so we&#39;ll have to wait until next summer (at least) to get a look at them. Some broad stats can be shared however: the market predicted a 54% chance of replication on average—and 54% of the replications succeeded (the market isn&#39;t <em>that</em> good, it got lucky).</p><p>Of 107 claims that resolved, I have data on 31 which I made money on. For the rest I either had no shares, or had shares in the incorrect direction. Since I only have data on the successes, there&#39;s no way to judge my performance right now.</p><p><strong>Survey vs Market Payouts</strong></p><p>The survey round payout scheme was top-heavy, and small variations in performance resulted in large differences in winnings. The market payout on the other hand was more or less communistic. Everyone gets the same number of points; and it was difficult to either gain or lose too many of them in the two weeks of trading. As a result, the final distribution of prizes is rather flat. At best a good forecaster might increase earnings by ~10% by exploiting mispricings, plus a bit more through intelligent trading. The Gini coefficient of the survey payouts was 0.76, while the Gini of the market payouts was 0.63 (this is confounded by different participation levels, but you get the point).</p><p>This was backwards. I think one of the most important aspects of &quot;ideal&quot; prediction markets is that informed traders can compound their winnings, while uninformed traders go broke. The market mechanism works well because the feedback loop weeds out those who are consistently wrong. This element was completely missing in the RM project. I think the market payout scheme should have been top-heavy, and should have allowed for compounding across rounds, while the survey round should have been flatter in order to incentivize broader participation.</p><h1 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1><p>If the market had kept going, my next step would have been to use other people&#39;s trades to update my estimates. The idea was to look at their past trades to determine how good they were (based on the price movement following their trade), then use the magnitude of their trades to weigh their confidence in each trade, and finally incorporate that info in my own forecast. Overall it&#39;s fascinating how even a relatively simple market like this has tons of little nuances, exploitable regularities, and huge potential for modeling and trading strategies of all sorts.</p><p>In the end, are subsidized markets necessary for predicting replication? Probably not. The predictions will(?) be used to train our AI replacements, and I believe SCORE&#39;s other replication prediction project, <a href="https://replicats.research.unimelb.edu.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repliCATS</a>, successfully used (cheaper) discussion groups. It will be interesting to see how the two approaches compare. Tetlock&#39;s research shows that working as part of a team increases the accuracy of forecasters, so it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if repliCATS comes out ahead. A combination of teams (aided by ML) and markets would be the best, but at some point the marginal accuracy gains aren&#39;t really worth the extra effort and money.</p><p>I strongly believe that identifying reliable research is <em>not</em> the main problem in social science today. The real issue is making sure unreliable research is not produced in the first place, and if it <em>is</em> produced, to make sure it does not receive money and citations. And for that you have to change The Incentives.</p><hr><p>PS. Shoot me an email if you&#39;re doing anything interesting and/or lucrative in forecasting.</p><p>PPS.

Re-read. What was that Coleridge quip? &quot;All men are born Herodotians or Thucydideans&quot;? Something like that. Anyway, I was definitely born a Herodotian. Thucydides is a historian with the soul of an accountant. Still, there are things to appreciate in that attitude: while most ancient historians never saw an army smaller than 400,000, he&#39;s happy to tell you about engagements with 60 hoplites and 20 archers. And keeping track of a myriad engagements, covering Asia Minor, Greece, and Italy, over the span of multiple decades is extremely impressive.</p><p>How prescriptive is Thuc&#39;s realpolitik? I&#39;m not entirely sure, it certainly didn&#39;t do the Athenians any good. He&#39;s obviously a skeptic when it comes to the supernatural, and there&#39;s very little room for morality in his history; is this an artifact of the lack of morality in the way the Athenian went about their affairs, or is this something Thuc projects onto them? One interesting point is that his story draws on the structure of tragedy: the hubris of the Sicilian expedition is ultimately punished; the players seem to lack any ability to change course. Perhaps morality plays no role in this history because Thuc views the path taken by each polis as <em>deterministic</em>. (This applies both to the &quot;Thucydides trap&quot; specifically, and also more generally).</p><p>On the question of direct democracy as a system of government things are a bit clearer as Thuc doesn&#39;t hide his views. He&#39;s short on alternatives though; the traditional polis obviously can&#39;t cope with the environment of the 4th century, but Thuc can&#39;t really see beyond it.</p><p>There are apparently some people who think Thucydides influenced the Neoconservatives, and I find that utterly absurd. Thuc is extraordinarily cynical when it comes to &quot;spreading freedom&quot;-style justifications for war, and if there&#39;s any realpolitik involved in spending trillions so that Afghan women can get gender studies degrees for 20 years before the Taliban come back, I&#39;m not seeing it.</p><p>One of the things that stand out is how bad the Greeks are at war. Reading Thuc, you&#39;re constantly thinking &quot;well of course these guys got rolled by the Romans&quot;. How did they beat the Persians so hard? Sieges seem to be a sticking point (something Phillip II turned out to be quite good at), so perhaps the open battles against the Persians played into their hands, or perhaps it was simply a matter of mismatched unit compositions. On the other hand the Athenians were extraordinarily persistent; even after the plague and the Sicilian disaster they still kept going for years, possibly only losing due to the Persian money flowing into the Spartan coffers.</p><p>If you haven&#39;t read any histories of the Pelopponesian war, this is highly recommended, just keep in mind it&#39;s very unfinished.

This book has an incredibly ambitious thesis: it argues that the world became modern due to the rediscovery of Lucretius&#39; <em>De Rerum Natura</em>. Unfortunately the evidence presented in favor of that thesis is pretty weak, and the book suddenly ends right as it starts to get into a groove. Still, it&#39;s fairly entertaining and has a ton of interesting anecdotes from the life of Poggio Bracciolini (the man who rediscovered Lucretius).</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Origin-Species-Everymans-Library-Classics/dp/1857152581?dchild=1&keywords=The+Origin+of+Species+everyman&qid=1633048213&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=c81c68353744c2314526516fb2bcf178&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Origin of Species</a></strong>, by Charles Darwin. A fairly dry read, its value today mainly lies in its documentation of the discovery of evolution, and in showing how Darwin could reason his way forward despite rather limited means (not even an inkling of DNA!). It was cool to see the role geology played in the development of evolutionary theory, and there&#39;s a very interesting passage (at the end of the chapter ON THE IMPERFECTION OF THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD) in which Darwin <em>almost</em> invents plate tectonics based on the geographical distribution of species. It&#39;s difficult to recommend: if you want to learn about evolution, pick up a modern textbook; if you&#39;re interested in the history of science you should probably read a historian; and if you just want to read something cool by Charles Darwin, pick up his Beagle adventure.</p></li></ul><h3 id="Fiction"><a href="#Fiction" class="headerlink" title="Fiction"></a>Fiction</h3><ul><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Upon-Deep-Zones-Thought/dp/0812515285?&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=4cd132bb2522294b09d8f5180751101d&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Fire Upon the Deep</a></strong>, by Vernor Vinge. Some pretty cool worldbuilding, with a universe divided into zones where different levels of technology are possible (the highest one is filled with Gods who quickly commit suicide). One of the main alien races is a sentient houseplant riding a roomba (seriously). But half the novel is wasted on a dull isekai story about some annoying kids stuck on a backwards planet with telepathic wolves, making the thing way overlong.

A new novel in the Revelation Space universe, unfortunately it&#39;s also the worst novel in the Revelation Space universe. It&#39;s a bit like a horror theme park, going from one ride to the next with little to no connective tissue between them. Even worse, many of the rides are completely nonsensical given the setting (humanity has almost been completely wiped out by the inhibitors).

The latter writes: &quot;Vasari, impelled by the unexampled artistic outburst of his time, divided his energies between his profession of painter and builder in Florence and biographer of the modern masters in the three great arts of design. His huge collection of Lives, which is a delight to read as well as a unique source of cultural history, was an amazing performance in an age that lacked organized means of research. [...] Throughout, Vasari makes sure that his reader will appreciate the enhanced human powers shown in the works that he calls &quot;good painting&quot; in parallel with &quot;good letters.&quot;&quot;</p><p>Vasari was mainly a painter, but also worked as an architect. He was not the greatest artist in the world, but he had a knack for ingratiating himself with the rich and powerful, so his career was quite successful. Besides painting, he also cared a lot about conservation: both the physical preservation of works and the conceptual preservation of the fame and biographies of artists. He gave a kind of immortality to many lost paintings and sculptures by describing them to us in his book.</p><p>His <em>Lives</em> are a collection of more than 180 biographies of Italian artists, starting with Cimabue (1240-1302) and reaching a climax with Michelangelo Buonarroti (1475-1564). They&#39;re an invaluable resource, as there is very little information available about these people other than his book; his biography of Botticelli is 8 pages long, yet on Botticelli&#39;s wikipedia page, Vasari is mentioned 36 times.</p><p>He was a straight-laced man surrounded on all sides by wild and eccentric artists. While Vasari was a sober businessman, always delivering his work on time, the people he was writing about were usually tempestuous madmen who would take commissions and leave the work unfinished, or go off on the slightest affront and start hacking apart their own works. Even of the great Leonardo he writes that &quot;through his comprehension of art, [he] began many things and never finished one of them&quot;.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>The greater part of the craftsmen who had lived up to that time had received from nature a certain element of savagery and madness, which, besides making them strange and eccentric, had brought it about that very often there was revealed in them rather the obscure darkness of vice than the brightness and splendour of those virtues that make men immortal.</p></div></blockquote><p>Many of them were undone by their love of food, drink, and/or women:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>...when his dear friend Agostino Chigi commissioned him to paint the first loggia in his palace, Raffaello was not able to give much attention to his work, on account of the love that he had for his mistress.</p></div></blockquote><p>Gwern&#39;s review of the <a href="https://www.gwern.net/reviews/Books#the-autobiography-of-benvenuto-cellini-cellini-1999" target="_blank" rel="noopener">autobiography of Cellini</a> (which includes the words &quot;aside from the demonology and weather-controlling&quot;) should give you a taste of what these guys were like.</p><img src="/images/vasari_priceofgreatness-2ba4f2639531ab434d44eca64bac89c5.png" width="568" height="376" title="price of greatness" alt="Arnold M. Ludwig, The Price of Greatness: Resolving the Creativity and Madness Controversy"><span class="image-caption">Arnold M. Ludwig, The Price of Greatness: Resolving the Creativity and Madness Controversy</span><p>Vasari&#39;s approach to the truth can be described as loose, if not gossipy. Many of the lives include fabricated elements, sometimes obviously so: I doubt anyone ever believed the story of Cimabue taking on Giotto as a pupil after seeing him scratch a painting on a stone. One of the most striking tales is the murder of Domenico Veneziano by Andrea del Castagno, but in reality Castagno actually died first. Vasari also damaged the reputation of some of his competitors, such as Jacopo da Pontormo, whom he portrayed as a paranoid recluse.</p><p>Vasari is also hilariously biased in favor of Florence: &quot;in the practice of these rare exercises and arts—namely, in painting, in sculpture, and in architecture—the Tuscan intellects have always been exalted and raised high above all others&quot;. The story of his visit to Titian (a Venetian) is typical:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>One day as Michelangelo and Vasari were going to see Titian in the Belvedere, they saw in a painting he had just completed a naked woman representing Danae with Jupiter transformed into a golden shower on her lap, and, as is done in the artisan&#39;s presence, they gave it high praise. After leaving Titian, and discussing his method, Buonarroti strongly commended him, declaring that he liked his colouring and style very much but that it was a pity artisans in Venice did not learn to draw well from the beginning and that Venetian painters did not have a better method of study.</p></div></blockquote><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Titian_-_Danae_%28Hermitage_Version%29.jpg" width="565" height="359" title="Titian Danae" alt="Titian, Danae with Jupiter as a &quot;golden shower&quot;"><span class="image-caption">Titian, Danae with Jupiter as a &quot;golden shower&quot;</span><p>I read (as usual) the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Painters-Sculptors-Architects-Everymans-Library/dp/0679451013?dchild=1&keywords=vasari+everyman&qid=1631491236&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=215f498a7fc651d15b2a9cad6eae5e25&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Everyman edition</a>, but would not recommend braving the entire work unless you&#39;re a Renaissance art fanatic.

Petrarch (1304-1374) invented the idea of the dark ages in order to explain the deficiencies of his own time relative to the ancients, and dreamt of a better future:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>My fate is to live among varied and confusing storms. But for you perhaps, if as I hope and wish you will live long after me, there will follow a better age. This sleep of forgetfulness will not last forever. When the darkness has been dispersed, our descendants can come again in the former pure radiance.</p></div></blockquote><p>To this scheme of ancient glory and medieval darkness, Vasari added a third—modern—age and gave it a name: <em>rinascita</em>.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn15039362642" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref15039362642">2</sup></a></span> And within his <em>rinascita</em>, Vasari described an upward trajectory starting with Cimabue, and ending in a golden age beginning with eccentric Leonardo and crazed sex maniac Raphael, only to give way to the perfect Michelangelo in the end. It is a trajectory driven by the modern conception of the artist as an individual <em>auteur</em>, rather than a faceless craftsman.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>The most benign Ruler of Heaven in His clemency turned His eyes to the earth, and, having perceived the infinite vanity of all those labours, the ardent studies without any fruit, and the presumptuous self-sufficiency of men, which is even further removed from truth than is darkness from light, and desiring to deliver us from such great errors, became minded to send down to earth a spirit with universal ability in every art and every profession.</p></div></blockquote><p>This golden age was certainly no utopia, as 16th century Italy was ravaged by political turbulence, frequent plague, and incessant war. Many of the artists mentioned were at some point taken hostage by invading armies; Vasari himself had to rescue a part of Michelangelo&#39;s David when it was broken off in the battle to expel the Medici from Florence.</p><p>And yet Vasari saw greatness in his time, and the entire book is structured around a narrative of artistic progress. He documented the spread of new technologies and techniques (such as the spread of oil painting, imported from the Low Countries), which—as an artist—he had an intimate understanding of.</p><p>This story of progress is paralleled with the rediscovery (and, ultimately, surpassing) of the ancients. It would take until the 17th century for the <em>querelle des Anciens et des Modernes</em> to really take off in France, but in Florence Vasari had already seen enough to decide the question in favor of his contemporaries—the essence of the Enlightenment is already present in 1550. He writes about Donatello (1386-1466), who produced the first nude male sculpture of the modern era:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>The talent of Donato was such, and he was so admirable in all his actions, that he may be said to have been one of the first to give light, by his practice, judgment, and knowledge, to the art of sculpture and of good design among the moderns; and he deserves all the more commendation, because in his day, apart from the columns, sarcophagi, and triumphal arches, there were no antiquities revealed above the earth. And it was through him, chiefly, that there arose in Cosimo de&#39; Medici the desire to introduce into Florence the antiquities that were and are in the house of the Medici; all of which he restored with his own hand.</p></div></blockquote><p>Similarly, he explains that Mino da Fiesole&#39;s (1429-1484) work was &quot;somewhat stiff&quot;, yet it was nonetheless admired because &quot;few antiquities had been discovered up to that time&quot;. The ancients created a new higher standard, which first created a thirst for imitation, then an impetus to outclass it.</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>...their successors were enabled to attain to it through seeing excavated out of the earth certain antiquities cited by Pliny as amongst the most famous, such as the Laocoon, the Hercules, the Great Torso of the Belvedere, and likewise the Venus, the Cleopatra, the Apollo, and an endless number of others, which, both with their sweetness and their severity, with their fleshy roundness copied from the greatest beauties of nature, and with certain attitudes which involve no distortion of the whole figure but only a movement of certain parts, and are revealed with a most perfect grace, brought about the disappearance of a certain dryness, hardness, and sharpness of manner...</p></div></blockquote><p>It is curious that this competitive attitude seems to have disappeared in later eras. In the 18th century, for example, the English painter Joshua Reynolds said of the Belvedere Torso that it retained &quot;the traces of superlative genius…on which succeeding ages can only gaze with inadequate admiration.&quot; The Italians of the Renaissance had such a civilizational confidence and such an individual lust for Glory that these fatalistic thoughts would never enter their minds. Take Raphael&#39;s <em>School of Athens</em> for example: imagine the self-confidence (if not presumption) necessary to paint Plato (portrayed by da Vinci) and Heraclitus (portrayed by Michelangelo) in the form of your friends and contemporaries! Imagine someone trying that today—Dennet as Plato, Gaspar Noé as...Diogenes?</p><p>What came first, the excellence or the confidence? Who can disentangle cause and effect? Braudel suggests an initial &quot;restlessness&quot; created the necessary conditions:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Perhaps if the door is to be opened to innovation, the source of all progress, there must be first some restlessness which may express itself in such trifles as dress, the shape of shoes and hairstyles?</p></div></blockquote><p>Vasari certainly thought this ambition was a necessary ingredient for greatness. Commenting on Andrea del Sarto, he writes that he was excellent in all skills but &quot;a certain timidity of spirit and a sort of humility and simplicity in his nature made it impossible that there should be seen in him that glowing ardour and that boldness which, added to his other qualities, would have made him truly divine in painting&quot;.</p><p>And one may ask: why is there no ancient Vasari? Pliny, describing the Laocoön, writes that it is &quot;a work to be preferred to all that the arts of painting and sculpture have produced&quot;. Yet he is content to simply mention the names of the artists in passing: Agesander, Athenodorus, and Polydorus of Rhodes. There is not the slightest hint of curiosity about the lives of those most excellent men. Even worse, they were (highly-skilled) copyists, selling reproductions of Hellenistic works to wealthy Romans. The name of the original sculptor is lost to time.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn15039362643" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref15039362643">3</sup></a></span></p><h2 id="Aesthetic-Value-Over-Time"><a href="#Aesthetic-Value-Over-Time" class="headerlink" title="Aesthetic Value Over Time"></a>Aesthetic Value Over Time</h2><p>You&#39;re probably familiar with the story of the Mona Lisa: it was unpopular until it was stolen in 1911, Apollinaire and Picasso were suspects in the case, and when it was finally returned two years later it had become the most famous painting in the world. I was surprised, then, to see that the Mona Lisa was singled out for effusive praise by Vasari. He even focuses on that famous smile:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>For Francesco del Giocondo, Leonardo undertook the portrait of Mona Lisa, his wife, and after working on it for four years, he left the work unfinished, and it may be found at Fontainebleau today in the possession of King Francis. Anyone wishing to see the degree to which art can imitate Nature can easily understand this from the head, for here Leonardo reproduced all the details that can be painted with subtlety. The eyes have the lustre and moisture always seen in living people, while around them are the lashes and all the reddish tones which cannot be produced without the greatest care. The eyebrows could not be more natural, for they represent the way the hair grows in the skin—thicker in some places and thinner in others, following the pores of the skin. The nose seems lifelike with its beautiful pink and tender nostrils. The mouth, with its opening joining the red of the lips to the flesh of the face, seemed to be real flesh rather than paint. Anyone who looked very attentively at the hollow of her throat would see her pulse beating: to tell the truth, it can be said that portrait was painted in a way that would cause every brave artist to tremble and fear, whoever he might be. Since Mona Lisa was very beautiful, Leonardo employed this technique: while he was painting her portrait, he had musicians who played or sang and clowns who would always make her merry in order to drive away her melancholy, which painting often brings to portraits. And in this portrait by Leonardo, there is a smile so pleasing that it seems more divine than human, and it was considered a wondrous thing that it was as lively as the smile of the living original.</p></div></blockquote><p>There are, however, one or two minor problems with his account. One of them is that Vasari never actually saw the Mona Lisa: he was about 6 years old when the painting was moved to France, and he never left Italy. Vasari also says that Leonardo left the painting unfinished, while the Mona Lisa is very much finished. So what&#39;s going on? Until the 20th century people simply thought he made it up based on sketches or second-hand accounts.</p><p>And then, in 1913, an art collector discovered a <em>second Mona Lisa</em> hanging in a house in Somerset. By all accounts it appears to be authentic, and it matches a sketch by Raphael. It&#39;s also a better match for Vasari&#39;s description, though he may not have seen this one either. If he thought this one was great, just imagine how he would have raved about the <em>first</em> Mona Lisa!</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Isleworthml.JPG/1567px-Isleworthml.JPG" width="565" height="738" title="The Second Mona Lisa" alt="The Second Mona Lisa"><span class="image-caption">The Second Mona Lisa</span><p>This raises the question: do we venerate the same paintings as Vasari due to path dependency, or due to constancy in aesthetic judgment? Broadly, Vasari&#39;s taste is our own. He likes Raphael, da Vinci, and Michelangelo above all others. There are certainly those who argue that the influence and worship of Florentine artists is merely a historical accident, and if Vasari had been a Venetian the history of painting would have turned out rather different.</p><p>There are a few interesting points of difference. For example, Botticelli only gets a very short biography, and his <em>Birth of Venus</em> merits not more more than a passing comment: Vasari says &quot;he expressed himself with grace&quot;. Another artist who was mostly ignored by Vasari and was later &quot;reevaluated&quot; is the highly erotic Antonio da Correggio.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Antonio_Allegri%2C_called_Correggio_-_Jupiter_and_Io_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/884px-Antonio_Allegri%2C_called_Correggio_-_Jupiter_and_Io_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg" width="565" height="1309" title="Jupiter and Io" alt="Correggio, Jupiter and Io"><span class="image-caption">Correggio, Jupiter and Io</span><h2 id="Architecture"><a href="#Architecture" class="headerlink" title="Architecture?"></a>Architecture?</h2><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>YOU - Hold on, is architecture also art?</p><p>CONCEPTUALIZATION - Of course not, it&#39;s autism.

Certainly no twenty-first century chronicler would collect the lives of painters, sculptors, and <em>architects</em>. In our own age architecture is little more than an exercise in applied misanthropy. It has gotten so bad <a href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/2017/10/why-you-hate-contemporary-architecture" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even the commies</a> can tell it sucks, and they&#39;re not exactly famous for their aesthetic discernment. And these Renaissance artists were not limited to constructing fancy villas or churches, they often got involved in military engineering as well!</p><p>Architects might try to defend themselves by appealing to specialization and saying that, as the science has progressed, an architect today requires far more specialized knowledge than they did in the 16th century. One cannot be both a painter and an architect at the same time. Yet I cannot help but notice that the Duomo and the Uffizi are still beautiful and still standing, while our contemporary concrete claptrap starts crumbling after a couple of years. Our segregation of these fields is both arbitrary and misguided. Perhaps education (and the way it commoditizes knowledge) is to blame.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn15039362644" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref15039362644">4</sup></a></span></p><h2 id="Human-Capital-Power-Laws-and-Cluster-Effects"><a href="#Human-Capital-Power-Laws-and-Cluster-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Human Capital, Power Laws, and Cluster Effects"></a>Human Capital, Power Laws, and Cluster Effects</h2><p>Perhaps the reason these people were able to paint, sculpt, architect, and sometimes even do a bit of military engineering on the side, is that art was one of very few avenues available at the time for people to monetize their high human capital. A smart guy in 16th century Florence had limited options: he might go into law, try to be a scribe, or (if he had money) commerce. Science was not a profession, and there were no hedge funds or startups. Art offered a new avenue, open to all with talent.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn15039362645" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref15039362645">5</sup></a></span></p><p>Art was also something of a winner-take-all market, with virtually unlimited upside for the select few who could make it to the top. Like modern athletes, the superstars were drowning in money while the average painter didn&#39;t make all that much. Time seems to have confirmed this power law in artistic excellence: nobody goes to a museum for the paintings of Bartolomeo Vivarini, while da Vinci draws millions every year.</p><p>Societies are broadly defined by how they allocate status and (by extension) how they allocate the scarce biological resources they have access to. Rome rewarded military leadership, so it got a lot of great generals (and civil wars). The kleptocrats of Renaissance Italy allocated talent to art; gold and fame attracted competence. At the time Vasari was writing, there were about thirty thousand men in Florence—roughly the same as the number of male citizens in Classical Athens, and also roughly the same as today&#39;s population of Dubuque, Iowa. Yet their achievements (to borrow a phrase from Gibbon) would excuse the computation of imaginary millions.</p><p>One might ask: where are all the Shakespeares? There are about 25x more literate men in England today than in 1564, how come we aren&#39;t producing 25x more Shakespeares? The answer is that our society does not allocate much of its human capital to playwriting. There are (potentially) great authors who spend 8 hours a day writing ads for cereal, or improving trading algorithms by 0.01%. Capitalism, for all its virtues, tends to instill a preference for <em>mere optimization</em> in its subjects; the shadow of utility blots out the impetus for Glory.</p><p>One of the starkest lessons from Vasari is the importance of clusters in artistic production. He highlights both the spur of competition and the virtues of learning through imitation. He documents how new techniques (oil, perspective, new approaches to color) spread like wildfire, and how the newly unearthed Roman statues provided both a lesson and a stimulus for improvement. The mentor-mentee relationship was extremely important; a young artist could destroy his entire career by choosing the wrong master.</p><p>There is an extensive literature in &quot;economics&quot;<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn15039362646" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref15039362646">6</sup></a></span> covering the influence of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S016604621830423X" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agglomeration in creative industries</a>.

And it was on that account that Rustici used to say in his more mature years that you must first think, then make your sketches, and after that your designs; which done, you must put them aside for weeks and even months without looking at them, and then, choosing the best, put them into execution; but that method cannot be followed by everyone, nor do those use it who labour only for gain.</p></div></blockquote><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Giorgio_Vasari_Selbstportr%C3%A4t.jpg" title="Giorgio Vasari" alt="Giorgio Vasari, Self-portrait"><span class="image-caption">Giorgio Vasari, Self-portrait</span><div class="subscribediv" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:250px;margin-top:30px"><form class="validate" action="https://fantasticanachronism.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=2a6ff66ec7039625cb12680d5&amp;amp;id=f713c1306c" method="post" id="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" target="_blank"><div class="mc-field-group"><input class="required email" type="email" name="EMAIL" id="mce-EMAIL" placeholder="Type your email..."></div><div class="clear" id="mce-responses"><div class="respose" id="mce-error-response" style="display:none"></div><div class="respose" id="mce-success-response" style="display:none"></div></div><div style="position:absolute;left:-5000px" aria-hidden="true"><input type="text" name="b_2a6ff66ec7039625cb12680d5_f713c1306c" tabindex="-1"></div><div class="clear"><input type="submit" value="Subscribe" name="subscribe" id="mc-embedded-subscribe" clas="button"></div></form></div><div id="footnotes"><hr><div id="footnotelist"><ol style="list-style:none;padding-left:0;margin-left:40px"><li id="fn15039362641"><span style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;padding-right:10px;margin-left:-40px">1.</span><span><span class="footnote-contents">&quot;And without Giorgio Vasari of Arezzo and his all-important work, we should perhaps to this day have no history of northern art, or of the art of modern Europe, at all.&quot;</span><a href="#fnref15039362641" rev="footnote"> ↩</a></span></li><li id="fn15039362642"><span style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;padding-right:10px;margin-left:-40px">2.</span><span><span class="footnote-contents">The word &quot;renaissance&quot; was only popularized in the 19th century by Michelet.</span><a href="#fnref15039362642" rev="footnote"> ↩</a></span></li><li id="fn15039362643"><span style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;padding-right:10px;margin-left:-40px">3.</span><span><span class="footnote-contents">There was a sculptor-biographer named Xenokrates of Sicyon but all his works are lost.</span><a href="#fnref15039362643" rev="footnote"> ↩</a></span></li><li id="fn15039362644"><span style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;padding-right:10px;margin-left:-40px">4.</span><span><span class="footnote-contents">McKenzie Wark: &quot;Education “disciplines” knowledge, segregating it into homogenous “fields,” presided over by suitably “qualified” guardians charged with policing its representations.

About 20 years ago, British Petroleum launched an ad campaign popularizing the notion and put out a website letting you calculate your &quot;carbon footprint&quot;. They&#39;re <a href="https://www.knowyourcarbonfootprint.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still at it</a>.</p><img src="/images/ibs_carbon_footprint-d8eccf802857986099b62b7ec5ccbdc1.png"><p>It&#39;s an idea with remarkable memetic power, both for individuals and brands. Displaying your concern about your personal carbon footprint lets you show off your prosociality and marks you out as someone virtuous, someone who takes personal responsibility. The idea also feeds into people&#39;s narcissistic tendencies, reassuring them that they&#39;re actually important and that their actions matter in the world.</p><p>Marketers love the concept, and any company trying to appeal to the nature-loving demographic can use and abuse it: <a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/outdoor-brands-get-serious-about-carbon-footprint-adventure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Outdoor Brands Get Serious About the Carbon Footprint of Adventure: The North Face and Protect Our Winters unveil an activism-oriented CO2 calculator</a>.</p><p>The problem with all of this, and the reason BP pushed the idea in the first place, is that your personal carbon footprint doesn&#39;t matter. You&#39;re 1 of about 7.6 billion people on earth, so your effect is about 1/7,600,000,000 ≈ 0.000000013%. Your personal carbon footprint is completely irrelevant to climate change. Global warming is a collective issue that requires collective solutions; framing it as a problem that <em>individuals</em> can tackle (and that individuals are responsible for) distracts from the <em>public</em> policy changes that are necessary. Environmentalist signaling is complete nonsense but also deadly serious.</p><h2 id="The-Parallel"><a href="#The-Parallel" class="headerlink" title="The Parallel"></a>The Parallel</h2><p>Caring about individual bad studies is a bit like caring about your individual carbon footprint.</p><p>People occasionally send me shitty papers, and year or two ago I would care a lot, enjoying the shameful thrill of getting Mad Online about some fraud, or having fun picking apart yet another terrible study. It&#39;s an attractive activity, and performing it in public shows how much you care about Good Science. Picking out a single paper to replicate operates at the same level. What&#39;s the impact of all this?</p><p>In the idealized version of science, a replication failure would raise serious doubts about the veracity of the original study and have all sorts of downstream effects. In the real version of social science, none of that matters. You have to go on active memetic warfare if you want to have any effect, and even then there&#39;s no guarantee you&#39;ll succeed.

We might make a similar argument about longtermism in social science: the vast majority of papers lie in the future. If we can do something today to improve them even by a little bit, the cumulative impact would be enormous. On the other hand, defeating one of the 10,000 bad papers that will be published this year is not going to do much at all. Effective scientific altruism is systematically improving the future by 0.01% rather than putting your energy into deboonking a single study.

Vasari was a painter and architect who lived in the first half of the 16th century and personally knew many of the greats (including Michelangelo). In this gossipy collection of biographies he covers more than 180 artists, starting with Cimabue and Giotto in the 13thC and ending with Michelangelo and others who were still alive at the time of writing (like Titian and Jacopo Sansovino). The ideas of progress and renaissance are front and center: the great ancients, the decline in the middle ages, and finally the triumphant rebirth of art in his own era. Parts of it are excellent, but it can get a bit dry and repetitive when he describes various minor artists, so I probably wouldn&#39;t recommend the full 2000+ page unabridged version.

I was curious to see if there was anything in B&amp;R that Henrich failed to capture in his work, and the answer is broadly &quot;no&quot;, but there are a few interesting differences: while Henrich is rather triumphalist, B&amp;R take a much more skeptical view of cultural evolution (a Nietzschean perspective, though of course they don&#39;t cite him). Unfortunately most of the book is bogged down by a series of dull arguments against various opponents of cultural evolution.

Lots of great sentences and great paragraphs, unfortunately they do not combine to form a Great Novel, the ideas never coalesce into anything solid. DeLillo revisits many of his typical themes here: American foreign policy, terrorism, cults, etc. Rather presciently written in 1991, very pessimistic on the potentials of mass action. &quot;The future belongs to crowds.&quot;</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Libra-Contemporary-American-Fiction-DeLillo/dp/0140156046?dchild=1&keywords=libra+delillo&qid=1623099945&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=e60f828242f3b72add0362f51da7bf3a&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Libra</a></strong> by Don DeLillo. A semi-fictionalized biography of Lee Harvey Oswald, based on the CIA/Cuban exiles conspiracy theory of the JFK assassination. Somewhat conventional in its style, and Pynchonesque in its attitude: conspiracies, axes of control and influence, strange coincidences, overeager pattern-matching, taking liberties with history. It&#39;s lacking the humor though. There&#39;s also a kind of meta parallel story of an FBI agent trying to piece together all the evidence, meticulously going through even the tiniest element (much like DeLillo). Pretty good, but <em>The Names</em> remains my favorite DeLillo.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pussy-Delicious-Tacos/dp/1534647511?dchild=1&keywords=The+Pussy&qid=1623100083&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fantasticanch-20&linkId=0fbad1a099d64e184ec47fec40811754&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Pussy</a></strong> by Delicious Tacos.

These problems will be coming home to roost over the next few decades.</p><p>To put things into perspective: simply maintaining the current prime:aged ratio <a href="https://lantpritchett.org/the-future-is-older/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would require 383 million additional prime aged people by 2050</a>. The math is clear, and even if fertility tripled tomorrow morning there&#39;s a huge lag until that actually starts affecting the economy.</p><img src="/images/pensions_prime-aged-ratio-a85abb88ae0d92e7f86357ab46966e80.jpg"><p>How much will it cost? It&#39;s hard to say exactly, the projections depend on fertility, longevity, immigration, growth, and the actual pensions. Plus there are non-pension expenses to take into account: government-funded healthcare spending on retirees is going to increase as well. On the low end some (including the EU) project an increase in spending of just ~3% of GDP, but I find that highly implausible. My own forecast would be around 10% of GDP for the average advanced economy by 2050.</p><p>For countries with relatively low government spending and good growth prospects like the US this might not be a problem.

Combine that with low/zero growth and things start looking really bad.</p><p>Anyone under the age of 40 or so should expect to receive little in return for their pay-as-you-go pension system contributions. Is it unfair that today&#39;s workers slave away, are forced to give away all their money to the boomers, only to receive virtually nothing in return? Sure. Is there anything you can do about it? No. Welcome to democracy.</p><h2 id="Regional-Variation"><a href="#Regional-Variation" class="headerlink" title="Regional Variation"></a>Regional Variation</h2><p>There is enormous variation in pension systems both between and within countries.

This seems like one of the likelier scenarios for the next global recession. Of course many have predicted this collapse before, and they were wrong. But the demographic problem is unavoidable.</p><p>The retirement age is quite low: 60 for men and 55 for women; we can probably expect this to change which will give them a bit of breathing room. But any such changes are wildly unpopular. On top of that, pension funds are already heavily reliant on additional funding from the central government.</p><h3 id="USA"><a href="#USA" class="headerlink" title="USA"></a>USA</h3><p>Given its low average age and strong growth, the US is in a decent position compared to the EU and China.</p><p>But there is a large amount of variation within the country: some local governments are doing perfectly fine, while others have serious problems with defined-benefit pensions for public employees. Politicians have been promising generous pensions without bothering to fund them (with the assistance of absurd return assumptions from the funds): pensions give them the ability to offer huge payouts to special interest groups without impacting the budget immediately. The logic of public choice is so clear that there is only one really serious question left, and that is <a href="https://jacobitemag.com/2017/05/30/the-limits-of-public-choice-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">why states haven&#39;t collapsed already</a>.</p><p>As these pensions start taking up a larger percentage of state/local revenues, things will come to a head. In Illinois, for example, pensions took up about 4% of the budget in the 90s. Today it&#39;s <a href="https://www.illinoispolicy.org/reports/illinois-public-services-being-cut-to-pay-unsustainable-pension-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">25%</a> and growing. There are three alternatives, all painful: cut pensions, cut other services, or start raising taxes. How much of that will people tolerate before they start moving out?</p><p>If this were simply a horrific problem that we were trying to deal with, it would be bad enough. But it&#39;s a horrific problem that we are ignoring, and will continue ignoring until it blows up in our faces. In the middle of the longest bull market in US stock market history, pension deficits have ballooned:</p><img src="https://www.pewtrusts.org/-/media/data-visualizations/infographics/2020/06/changeinpensiondebt_figure1_650_3.png"><p>Just imagine what a decade of weak stock market returns would do.</p><p>At the federal level, Social Security has about 15 years until they have to start cutting benefits, but it won&#39;t be that expensive to shore it up.

All the alternatives seem bad: pension cuts, big tax increases, vast borrowing, inflation, unprecedented immigration. Nobody wants to do any of these things, but the math must eventually balance out. In the end something&#39;s gotta give. <a href="https://www.files.ethz.ch/isn/93971/RR%20036.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This survey</a> of Europeans captures the heart of the problem:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>When it comes to the measures required, even those respondents who acknowledge the threat of demographic problems appear to be fairly reluctant to endorse them: most of the reform proposals are refused by the majority.</p></div></blockquote><p>Everyone understands that governments either need to tax more or pay out less, but people aren&#39;t ready to accept either solution. Just 46% support a system that combines basic public pensions with private savings! Even conservatives in America hate the idea of cuts: <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/26/few-americans-support-cuts-to-most-government-programs-including-medicaid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just 15% of Republicans</a> support Medicare spending cuts, while 10% support Social Security cuts. And when you spend $2T on &quot;stimulus&quot; at a time when <a href="https://twitter.com/AlanMCole/status/1403171515512860678" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there is no AD shortfall</a>, how are you going to close the taps later? With such large political costs (old people are sympathetic, numerous, and politically influential),<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn4219857854" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref4219857854">4</sup></a></span> few politicians are willing to take the necessary steps. And the worse the worker:retiree ratio, the more political power the retirees have—this is not a self-balancing problem.</p><p>The example of Japan shows that these problems are not insurmountable, as long as politicians are willing to make difficult choices (and the people accept those choices). The earlier reforms are enacted, the easier things will go, but in most places I expect it will be impossible until a breaking point is reached. Maybe in the end we&#39;ll just get a little bit of everything and the math will balance out. But <em>someone</em> is going to have to make sacrifices.</p><p>The biggest danger comes not from the pension apocalypse itself, but rather from the stupid things politicians might do to avoid addressing the pension problem head-on. Some possible scenarios:</p><ul><li>Huge tax increases → mass emigration → death spiral</li><li>Central banks monetize debt → hyperinflation → economic crash</li><li>Central banks don&#39;t monetize debt → debt crisis → Greece 2.0</li></ul><h2 id="Grow"><a href="#Grow" class="headerlink" title="Grow"></a>Grow</h2><p>You can think of pension liabilities like debt: you can keep growing it forever without problem as long as you also grow your economy quickly enough. We can talk about progress studies as much as we want, but the practical reality on the ground is not encouraging when it comes to growth. Especially in Europe, it is more or less a distant dream rather than a real possibility. And things are slowing down even in the US.</p><p>China has no alternative, and so far it seems to be succeeding against all expectations (though the data is fake to some extent, see <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3093296" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a> and <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/bpea-articles/a-forensic-examination-of-chinas-national-accounts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a>). We&#39;ll see how long they can keep it up.</p><h2 id="Pay-Out-Less"><a href="#Pay-Out-Less" class="headerlink" title="Pay Out Less"></a>Pay Out Less</h2><p>One possibility is, of course, a straight cut to pensions. But you have to keep in mind that old people tend to vote at higher rates than young people, and that due to demographic collapse the old people will be the most powerful voting block in these countries. People get <a href="https://repositori.upf.edu/bitstream/handle/10230/19893/1342.pdf?sequence=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">angry</a> when you cut spending.<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn4219857855" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref4219857855">5</sup></a></span> They get especially angry when they have paid in quite a lot of money to the pension system and will not see much in return. Even the best-managed systems (like <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b42f5424-07c4-11ea-9afa-d9e2401fa7ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Dutch</a>) will be running into trouble though.</p><h2 id="Raise-the-Retirement-Age"><a href="#Raise-the-Retirement-Age" class="headerlink" title="Raise the Retirement Age"></a>Raise the Retirement Age</h2><p>Instead of paying out less, you can try to raise the retirement age instead. This not only decreases the total amount you need to pay, but also props up the worker:retiree ratio. It also has the benefit of not affecting current retirees: bypassing that powerful bloc makes changes easier to implement from a political perspective. But people in <a href="https://hollandfintech.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ING_International_Survey_Savings_Retirement_Saving_Challenges_2019_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surveys</a> say they expect to retire around 63, so I don&#39;t know how politically viable this plan is going to be in practice.</p><p>For example, Denmark plans to raise the retirement age in step with increases in life expectancy. Under this model, a Danish worker born in 1990 can expect &quot;early retirement&quot; at 70 and normal retirement at 73!</p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/oecdecoscope.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/blog-fig-2-retirement-age-Denmark-2019.png?w=743&ssl=1"><p>To which I say: fuck off and die.</p><p><strong>Edit:</strong> after some conversations I have decided that raising the retirement age might not be that bad. Lots of people are still able and willing to work in their 60s and 70s. The best solution would probably be a flexible system in which people can choose when to retire, and the benefits adjust accordingly (the earlier you stop working, the less you get).</p><h2 id="Tax"><a href="#Tax" class="headerlink" title="Tax"></a>Tax</h2><p>Raising taxes is another possibility, but how much slack is there in income taxation given a declining base? The US (which is currently at &lt;40% government spending/GDP) has a lot of wiggle room, and you could even say the same about China. But for Europe you have to figure that at some point they&#39;ll be hitting the downward slope of the Laffer curve. Emigration is easier than ever and the people with the greatest ability to work remotely also tend to be those who are most desirable from a fiscal perspective.</p><h2 id="Immigration"><a href="#Immigration" class="headerlink" title="Immigration"></a>Immigration</h2><p>The sheer number of people needed makes immigration a partial solution at best, and only a few countries use immigration in a way that actually helps. Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and Switzerland for example have fairly reasonable immigration policies that select for high human capital: Canada has the smartest immigrants in the world (<a href="https://pisadataexplorer.oecd.org/ide/idepisa/report.aspx?p=1-RMS-1-20153-PVMATH-IMMIG-AUS,AUT,BEL,CAN,CHL,CZE,DNK,EST,FIN,FRA,DEU,GRC,HUN,ISL,IRL,ISR,ITA,JPN,KOR,LVA,LUX,MEX,NLD,NZL,NOR,POL,PRT,SVK,SVN,ESP,SWE,CHE,TUR,GBR,USA-MN_MN-Y_J-0-0-37&Lang=1033" target="_blank" rel="noopener">average PISA math scores of 527</a>, higher than the natives&#39; and corresponding to an IQ around 103).

In Europe, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Migrant_integration_statistics_-_at_risk_of_poverty_and_social_exclusion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">non-EU migrants are less likely to be employed and earn much less than Europeans when they are employed</a>.

This process has already started, with some countries offering <a href="https://www.etiasvisa.com/etias-news/digital-nomad-visas-eu-countries" target="_blank" rel="noopener">digital nomad visas</a>, sometimes with tax incentives on top. In Italy some cities will pay <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/italy-towns-pay-remote-working-cmd/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">half your rent</a>. I imagine there will be calls for coordination to prevent a &quot;race to the bottom&quot;, but I doubt there will be any kind of global agreement on the matter.</p><h2 id="Debt"><a href="#Debt" class="headerlink" title="Debt"></a>Debt</h2><p>Hell, if zero rates persist you could just fund the whole thing with debt. Rising interest rate forecasts have been a <a href="http://unassumingeconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/WS_Forecasts.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complete meme</a> for more than a decade now, maybe free money is the new normal. On the other hand, at high levels of debt/GDP it only takes a small rise in rates to create serious problems (and possibly trigger debt crises). But how long can this last? Perhaps the &quot;solution&quot; to rising rates will be inflation, just kicking the can even further down the road.</p><h2 id="The-Andrew-Dobson-Gambit"><a href="#The-Andrew-Dobson-Gambit" class="headerlink" title="The Andrew Dobson Gambit"></a>The Andrew Dobson Gambit</h2><p><em>Inflate!</em></p><p>How much willingness for debt monetization is there among independent central banks? Probably not much (who knows though—remember &quot;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/SB126135515658499333" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no bailouts</a>&quot;? <a href="https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2456&context=ilj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lol</a>) On the other hand, how long can CBs retain their independence against mounting political pressure? What&#39;s more unpopular, high inflation or pension cuts? This seems like a fairly unlikely scenario.</p><h2 id="Transition-to-DC-Plans"><a href="#Transition-to-DC-Plans" class="headerlink" title="Transition to DC Plans"></a>Transition to DC Plans</h2><p>The countries that are best prepared have some combination of well-funded basic public pension system that makes sure old people don&#39;t starve, combined with defined-contribution pensions. Governments with large defined-benefit plans will either need to take serious pain, or start transitioning to defined-contribution plans. The problem with making this transition is that it&#39;s expensive immediately, and extremely difficult politically. They tried to do it in Illinois and it was <a href="https://www.illinoispolicy.org/reports/tax-hikes-vs-reform-why-illinois-must-amend-its-constitution-to-fix-the-pension-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shot down by the courts</a>:</p><blockquote><div class="blockquotediv"><p>Under the Illinois Supreme Court’s 2015 precedent, a government worker’s pension benefits cannot be changed in any way after their first day working for the state.</p></div></blockquote><p>If you thought pensioners were a powerful lobby, wait till you see what public employees get away with.</p><h1 id="What-You-Can-Do"><a href="#What-You-Can-Do" class="headerlink" title="What You Can Do"></a>What You Can Do</h1><p>First of all, understand that you <em>need</em> to save for retirement.</p><p>After that, just follow the standard boring investing advice. Right now is not a great time (high valuations after a 12-year bull market that quintupled the S&amp;P500, near-zero bond yields), but I&#39;m sure there will be good opportunities in the decades to come. The safe withdrawal rate (how much you can withdraw from your investments every year without running out of money before you die) is generally held to be around 3-4%. Suppose you can get by on $30k/year, you&#39;ll need $1m in investments. That number has to be adjusted for inflation: assuming you&#39;ll retire in 2060 and 2% inflation, that&#39;s $2.2m in 2060-dollars. Getting there isn&#39;t <em>that</em> difficult: saving $10k/year for 40 years with 7% annual returns will get you to $2m. The earlier you start the better.</p><p>Where to put the money? I&#39;d go with some sort of global equity ETF, perhaps with a tilt toward the US. Beware <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_home_bias_puzzle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">home equity bias</a>, unless you&#39;re American.</p><p>What happens if the political demands generated by the collapse of pension systems end up causing a hyperinflationary scenario? As long as you have the money in real estate or equities, you&#39;ll probably be fine. German stocks actually <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/heres-what-happened-to-stocks-during-the-german-hyperinflation-2011-11?IR=T&r=US&IR=T" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did fine</a> in the Weimar hyperinflation era (but only if you held them through an 80% drawdown).</p><p>It&#39;s an absolutely terrible time for bonds, don&#39;t be misled by the incredible bull market of the last 40 years. 60/40 is going to look much worse in the future. Inflation goes up, you&#39;re screwed; rates go up, you&#39;re screwed. The Greek 10y bond is currently yielding 0.824%—this is a country with a debt/GDP ratio over 200%, a GDP 35% lower than it was 10 years ago, and a recent history of default. The bond market is absolutely nuts right now.</p><img src="/images/pensions_10-year-treasury-bond-rate-yield-chart-435304fca3fe55364d751f17bbb58334.png" title="10y treasury bond yields"><p>If things get bad enough you might want to protect against expropriation, which means international diversification. But I doubt things will get that bad.</p><p>Looking beyond investments, you could move to a cheaper country, which would allow you to get away with lower savings. There are nice places in SEA or South America that are both civilized and cheap. It&#39;s pretty easy for Norteamericanos and Europeans with some savings to get retiree visas. If you were retiring now, Argentina would be an interesting choice: very cheap due to the currency situation but still a safe &amp; pleasant country. As long as your investments are in a stable currency, you can go wherever you want. On the other hand your home country might be unwilling to pay out even your meager pension if you don&#39;t actually live there, so plan accordingly.</p><p>You could also have more kids. The society-wide dependency ratio is going to be pretty bad, but if you have enough kids your family dependency ratio could be relied on instead. It&#39;s probably a bad idea to have kids as a retirement strategy, but if you&#39;re leaning in that direction already why not read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Selfish-Reasons-Have-More-Kids/dp/0465028616/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=selfish+reasons+kids&qid=1623248739&sr=8-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Caplan&#39;s book</a> and pop out another one?</p><h1 id="What-to-Expect"><a href="#What-to-Expect" class="headerlink" title="What to Expect"></a>What to Expect</h1><p>Some countries have a political culture that allows for tough decisions to be made and accepted, but for everyone else I think the most likely course is to kick the can down the road and muddle along while the problems accumulate, until a crisis erupts.</p><h2 id="Worst-Case-Scenario"><a href="#Worst-Case-Scenario" class="headerlink" title="Worst-Case Scenario"></a>Worst-Case Scenario</h2><p>Weimar, then war? Probably not. Societies filled with old people don&#39;t do revolution or war. The age of bangs is over; we only have whimpers to look forward to. At worst we&#39;ll see a death spiral of stagnation, brain drain, expropriation, and perhaps devaluation/inflation. Think South America. They won&#39;t let you starve, but it won&#39;t be very nice either. If the catastrophe isn&#39;t global, and you manage to keep your portfolio out of their hands, you&#39;ll be fine.</p><h2 id="Best-Case-Scenario"><a href="#Best-Case-Scenario" class="headerlink" title="Best-Case Scenario"></a>Best-Case Scenario</h2><p>Cheap fusion energy or friendly superhuman general artificial intelligence?<span class="tooltip"><a href="#fn4219857857" class="footnote-ref" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref4219857857">7</sup></a></span> If we get a significant increase in growth, the pension problems disappear.</p><div class="subscribediv" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:250px;margin-top:30px"><form class="validate" action="https://fantasticanachronism.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=2a6ff66ec7039625cb12680d5&amp;amp;id=f713c1306c" method="post" id="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" target="_blank"><div class="mc-field-group"><input class="required email" type="email" name="EMAIL" id="mce-EMAIL" placeholder="Type your email..."></div><div class="clear" id="mce-responses"><div class="respose" id="mce-error-response" style="display:none"></div><div class="respose" id="mce-success-response" style="display:none"></div></div><div style="position:absolute;left:-5000px" aria-hidden="true"><input type="text" name="b_2a6ff66ec7039625cb12680d5_f713c1306c" tabindex="-1"></div><div class="clear"><input type="submit" value="Subscribe" name="subscribe" id="mc-embedded-subscribe" clas="button"></div></form></div><div id="footnotes"><hr><div id="footnotelist"><ol style="list-style:none;padding-left:0;margin-left:40px"><li id="fn4219857851"><span style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;padding-right:10px;margin-left:-40px">1.</span><span><span class="footnote-contents">I believe the first such system was set up in Germany in 1889.</span><a href="#fnref4219857851" rev="footnote"> ↩</a></span></li><li id="fn4219857852"><span style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;padding-right:10px;margin-left:-40px">2.</span><span><span class="footnote-contents">They could theoretically cut spending on other things to compensate, but good luck with that.</span><a href="#fnref4219857852" rev="footnote"> ↩</a></span></li><li id="fn4219857853"><span style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;padding-right:10px;margin-left:-40px">3.</span><span><span class="footnote-contents">In Japan 28% of the population is &gt;65 years old.
